    "content": "What is a water and wastewater servicing strategy?\nA water and wastewater servicing strategy is a long-term plan that helps ensure communities have clean and safe water to use and drink, and that the water used is treated properly before being returned to the environment.\nA servicing strategy considers things like finding water sources, making sure we don't waste water, and building treatment plants to clean water and safely dispose of wastewater. The strategy also thinks about how we can ensure we have enough water for the future, and that our assets are durable and resilient to factors such as climate change.\nServicing strategies will be progressively developed for the 30 catchments across our network. In some cases, multiple catchments will be grouped together for a servicing strategy. A good example is the large metropolitan servicing strategy which will include many catchment areas from the North Shore through to south Auckland.\nOur servicing strategies will:\nBe long-term, looking out at least 70 years\nBe cognisant of mana whenua and local community values and aspirations\nConsider long-term impacts of external factors such as population growth, network demand, climate change, and changing regulatory requirements\nBe flexible and adaptable for future uncertainty, providing resilience for future generations\nProvide options and high-level cost estimates\nInform choices about water sources, discharge points, sea-level rise, resource allocation and priorities\nInform our Asset Management Plan (AMP) for future-focused investment planning and prioritisation.\nWhat does a servicing strategy consider?\nThe diagram below shows some of the many factors the servicing strategies will consider when planning for future decisions and investment. This includes various aspects of community wellbeing such as environmental, social, cultural, and economic. In the process of decision-making, trade-offs between various factors will be important. Making the right trade-offs and investment choices will help future communities remain healthy but also resilient to future challenges.\nWhy the need for a 70-year servicing strategy?\nInfrastructure servicing strategies are plans that ensure our water systems and physical assets are well-maintained and upgraded over time because they play a critical role in our daily lives. We plan for 70 years because infrastructure is expensive to build and maintain, and we want to make sure it lasts. To do this, we use an approach that breaks down the 70-year timeframe into smaller planning periods called horizons (refer to the below image). This helps decision-makers anticipate future needs, plan infrastructure development accordingly, and avoid costly last-minute investments. Anticipating future infrastructure needs can help build community resilience.\nBy anticipating major changes and being willing to adjust the servicing strategies and plans as conditions change, we can develop large-scale infrastructure projects that are aligned with future needs and prepared for potential challenges.\nHow do we work with mana whenua?\nOur relationship with mana whenua is a partnership. It is a collaborative relationship between local iwi or hapū, which recognises mana whenua as kaitiaki or guardians of the land. The partnership ensures that cultural values, knowledge, and aspirations are respected and integrated into our decision-making processes. This partnership involves the sharing of information, resources, and decision-making to address community and environmental issues. Working together, we can achieve better outcomes for the community, enhance cultural understanding, and promote environmental sustainability.\nWe recognise the significance of Mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems) and their valuable contribution towards preserving natural resources with a long-term vision. When we develop the servicing strategies and make decisions, these principles provide us with fresh perspectives and opportunities to achieve outcomes that are agreed to by everyone. Through our joint efforts, we can create positive outcomes for the community and safeguard our natural resources for generations to come. ­­"

Weaving the following tips into your routine will help you conserve water and lower your bill.\nFollow these links for water-efficiency tips:\nSave water in the garden\nSave water at home\nSave water at your workplace\n \nPreparing for a drought\nIn the preparing for a drought stage, our total dam storage level would be below where we’d like it to be and we'd be keeping a very close eye on water consumption along with the weather outlook. We may be preparing to put water restrictions in place, and will be working closely with Auckland Council, as the responsibility for introducing restrictions sits with Council.\nYou would expect to hear more from us with messages online and across social media urging everyone to use water wisely. We will be sharing our top water savings tips far and wide.\nStage 1 residential restrictions\nWatering lawns and gardens in residential premises\nThis is only permitted with an irrigation system, trigger nozzle on a handheld hose, or bucket in line with the following schedules:\n (a) Odd numbered properties - before 7am and after 7pm - Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays.\n(b) Even or un-numbered (rural) properties - before 7am and after 7pm - Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.\nA bucket or watering can may be used anytime, any day.\nCleaning hard surfaces in residential premises\nCleaning of paths, roads, driveways or outdoor artificial surfaces is not permitted except for spot cleaning for health and safety or biosecurity purposes. This must be done with a high-pressure water cleaner or water from a bucket.\nGeneral outdoor cleaning (other than hard surfaces) in residential premises\nGeneral outdoor cleaning can occur at any time using:\nA bucket or a high-pressure water cleaner for no longer than 10 minutes a day. \nGeneral outdoor cleaning includes (but is not limited to): \nExterior of building, landscaping (e.g. retaining walls).\nEntertainment and eating areas.\nVehicles (e.g. cars, boats, caravans, trailers, bikes, buses, trucks).\nOutdoor furniture and related equipment.\nRubbish bins, tools and related equipment, animal enclosures and kennels. \nSwimming pools, spas and recreational water use in residential premises\nTopping up an existing pool or spa to replace water lost is authorised using a handheld hose or bucket only. \nFilling of new or renovated pool or spa pool (volume >500L) is allowed only if a permanent pool/spa cover is in place to reduce evaporation. \nPaddling or temporary pools holding more than 500L may not be filled. \nUse of tankered drinking water \nTankers can only source drinking water from approved filling stations.\nTankers supplying the wider Auckland region for essential uses only are permitted to fill from our system. \nResidential customers who receive water from tankers that source water from our filling stations are subject to the same restrictions as our customers on the network. \nStage 1 business restrictions\nWatering lawns and gardens in non-residential premises\nVoluntary savings target of 5-10%.\nNon-business related cleaning\nVoluntary savings target of 5-10%.\nCommercial business functions\nVoluntary savings target of 5-10%.\nAgricultural and horticultural uses\nReplace potable water (water from the metropolitan network) with alternative sources where possible.\nIrrigation watering permitted only as required using a handheld hose with a trigger nozzle, watering can or bucket, or an irrigation system with an automated weather adjustment, rain sensor or soil moisture sensor.\nUse of tankered drinking water\nTankers can only source drinking water from approved Watercare filling stations.\nTankers supplying the wider Auckland region for essential uses only are permitted to fill from our system.\nNon-residential customers receiving water from tankers that source water from Watercare filling stations are subject to the same restrictions as our customers connected to the metropolitan network.

    "content": "Who installs and tests backflow devices?\nBoundary/containment devices \nWatercare installs all backflow devices except for fire supplies. As the property owner, you are responsible for maintaining and annually testing the correct backflow device at your boundary. \nWhen required, we reserve the right to fix or upgrade a faulty device to reduce risks to the water network. We will recover reasonable costs for this work from you.\nInternal devices\nAuckland Council oversees testing of backflow devices within your property.\nWhich water connections require a backflow device?\nResidential customers\nYou need a backflow device if you want to:\nInstall an irrigation meter\nInstall a fire sprinkler\n.\nBusiness customers\nYou need a backflow device if you want to:\nApply for a new or additional water meter\nMove or separate a meter\nInstall a fire sprinkler\nInstall an irrigation meter\nYou DO NOT need a device if you want to:\nDisconnect a meter\nIncrease meter size\nWhat information is required when I apply for a connection?\nWhen you apply to us for a water connection that requires a backflow device, you must include scale plans showing all existing or proposed backflow prevention devices. The plans must be stamped ‘approved’ by Auckland Council for building or resource consent.\nIs my property a backflow risk?\nProperties are classified into three degrees of risk. This determines the type of backflow device you need to install.\nHigh risk\nActivity:\n Uses or produces toxic or bacterial matter that may cause death or serious illness if leaked into the main water supply.\nExamples:\n Hospitals, mortuaries, chemical plants, cooling towers, air conditioners, hairdressing salons, commercial laundries.\nDevice:\n Reduced pressure zone.\nTesting:\n Annual.\nMedium risk\nActivity:\n Produces backflow that can endanger health.\nExamples:\n Public swimming pools, garden irrigation systems.\nDevice:\n Double-check valve.\nTesting: \nAnnual.\nLow risk\nActivity:\n Could cause a nuisance from colour, smell or taste but does not endanger health.\nExamples:\n Most private homes.\nDevice:\n Air gap separation or hose vacuum break valve.\nTesting:\n Annual.\nIdentifying high and medium-risk properties\nWe conduct regular surveys to find high and medium-risk properties that require backflow devices. If we identify your property, we will send you a letter advising you about surveying your property. We will send you the survey results and, if you need a backflow device, explain what you need to do.\nWhere are the devices installed?\nBackflow prevention devices can be either at the property boundary or within your property.\nBoundary or containment device\nThis is placed at your property boundary. Watercare oversees testing of it to ensure it fully complies with the \nWater Services Act\n. \nInternal device\nThis is placed within your property. Auckland Council oversees testing of it in conjunction with the Building Act.\nView the Water and Wastewater Network Bylaw (page 7)\nMore information\nPreventing backflow (PDF brochure)\nArrange a test\nTo test your device, you have two options:\n1. Ask us to test it\nEmail \n[email protected]\n or call us on (09) 442 2222. We will bill you for this service.\n2. Engage an independently qualified person (IQP) to test it\nTo find an IQP, go to the \nAuckland Council list of IQPs\n  (IQP= Independently qualified person)\nClick the Systems/Feature dropdown arrow and scroll to SS7. Select SS7 and click Search the Name, Suburb Address or other options to see a list of IQPs who can install or test your device.\nOn the search results page, click Expand All for contact details.\nGet a test certificate\nWhen your device passes the test, the tester issues a certificate. They may use their own certificate, or \ndownload our boundary backflow device test certificate\n.\nIf you use Watercare for testing, we will hold a copy of the certificate and supply this to you if required.\nIf you use an independent tester, they (or you) will need to email a copy of the certificate to us at \n[email protected]\n.\nIf we don’t receive a test certificate, we will arrange for your device to be tested, and will bill you.\nIf your device fails the test\nIf your device fails the test or you do not repair it on time, we will contact you stating that it is a high priority to repair it.\nIf you don’t repair and retest the device within 2 weeks of receiving this message, we will revisit the device, make repairs, and invoice you for this work.\nTesting charges\nAs the owner of a boundary backflow device you must pay for the tests. Independent testers will have their own fee schedule for this work.\nView current charges for testing the device\n."

    "content": "Shared meters \nSometimes two or more property owners share the same water meter and the water bill for each owner is based on readings from the single meter. Everyone who shares the meter pays an equal share of the bill. \nTypes of properties that may have shared meters:       \nFlats/units \nA main residence with a granny flat or standalone unit \nA mixed commercial-residential property. \nOur \nFAQs \nexplain more about shared meters and why you might separate from them. \nIrrigation meters\nFor watering large areas, an irrigation meter may save you money. An irrigation meter is a standalone meter that measures water used outdoors only, such as for watering big orchards, golf courses or large gardens. It works in the same way as a household water meter, with a dial that records the volume of water passing through it. \nFor detailed info including charges click the button below and read our FAQs. \nLearn more about irrigation meters \n \n \nCheck meters\nA check meter is a private meter that records your water use. If you’re on a shared meter and want to record your own water use, a check meter is cheaper than separating from a shared meter. \nAn example is a property owner who has a granny flat. They can measure the amount of water their tenant is using and legally charge the tenant for it under the Residential Tenancies Act. \nCheck meters are also used in blocks of apartments or townhouses. The body corporate reads the check meters to share out the monthly water bill between households.  \nRain tank water meters\nIf your household relies on a rain tank or bore water, it may be worth installing a meter. While we don’t supply your water, we do charge a fee for collecting and treating your wastewater. As a user of rain tank or bore water, you have two options for paying this: \nNo meter: you pay a fixed charge, which stays the same no matter how much wastewater you discharge. \nMeter: you pay a lower fixed charge, plus a volumetric component. The volumetric component will vary, based on the volume of water that flows through your meter. \nIf you’re a small household and use water efficiently (less than 220kL per year), your bills may be lower with a meter. \nOther things to consider \nYou must use an Elster Kent water meter. \nLocation: See our installation guidelines. \nResponsibilities: Rainwater tanks and household plumbing are private systems on private property. It’s your responsibility to maintain the water meter and your private plumbing network. \nMonthly bills and meter readings: We’ll send you a bill each month. Learn more.  \nThe timing of your first fixed/volumetric bill will depend on when the meter reader is in your area. In some cases, it may take up to two months for your first volumetric charges to appear on the bill. \nPlease note your bill totals may vary during the first few months as we gain enough information to accurately estimate your use. \nDownload PDFs \nQ and A: detailed information about rain tank water meters  \nRain tank water meter application form \nInstallation guidelines \nTerms and conditions\nOur water meter trial \n \n \nMaster and subsidiary meters\nIn this old set-up, householders share responsibilities. We no longer install meters in this configuration. However, it typically consists of: \na master meter: this is usually at the front of the property or building complex. It records all water that passes through the units or dwellings where water is connected. \nsubsidiary or sub meters: these are meters to individual properties that are connected to the master meter. They’re usually further down the line, outside the unit or dwelling they supply. They record water use for that dwelling. \nSome properties have unique arrangements. For instance, the line between the master meter and the sub-meters may feed a communal tap, pool, irrigation system or carport. \n \nDeduction meters\nWe no longer set up meters this way, however it’s still in use for some properties. In it, there’s a master deduction meter (the DD meter) and one or more sub deduction meters (D meters). Water passes first through the DD meter and then to the D meters. \nThe diagram shows an example of a deduction arrangement, where the two lower properties share the same private line."

    "content": "Can I reduce water hardness at home?\nIf you prefer your water to be soft, you may want to consider installing a domestic water softener that’s designed to remove both calcium and silica. There are many different systems available in New Zealand from a variety of suppliers. You would need to engage a plumber to install a softening device.\nIf you do install a water softener, we recommend you leave your kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking water as softeners can add higher levels of sodium to the water.\nHow can I reduce the formation of scale in my house?\nIf you would rather not install a water softener, the best way to prevent silica scaling is to dry surfaces like shower doors before the water evaporates. It can also be cleaned with a mildly abrasive glass cleaner. Scale in dishwashers and hot water cylinders can be reduced by lowering the temperature of your hot water system.\nPlease check with your dishwasher or washing machine manufacturer before adding any products to remove scaling.\n \nHow can I remove limescale? \nOne way to descale your kettle is to half-fill it with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar. Boil the mixture and then let it sit in the kettle for about 15 minutes. Pour it out and then rinse it thoroughly.\nTo clean your showerhead, fill a plastic bag with vinegar and tie it over the showerhead so it is submerged. Leave it like this overnight and then remove the bag. If your showerhead is removable, you can just submerge the showerhead in a bowl of vinegar."

    "content": "How is a town to tank connection different from a standard connection?\nA town to tank connection provides water at a lower flow rate than a standard water meter.\nTown to tank water meter: 2 to 8 litres per minute\nStandard water meter: at least 25 litres per minute\nThis means that with a town to tank connection, it could take around three days to top up a rain tank with 10,000 litres. With a standard connection, the water is plumbed directly into your home, not via your rain tank.\nWhat are the connection and ongoing charges?\nBelow are the connection and ongoing charges for town to tank and standard connections. This is to help you to compare the two options. In addition to these costs, you will need to engage a plumber to carry out work \non your side of the water meter.\nFurther information\nNew meter - The town to tank connection includes a service lead and backflow device.\nInfrastructure growth charge (IGC) - The Town to tank IGC is cheaper because the flow rate is lower than a standard connection. With a Town to tank connection, it could take around three days to top up a tank with 10,000 litres.\nApplication processing fee (per hour, one hour minimum)\nOngoing charges\nAnnual fixed water charge - Town to tank connection customers will pay the annual fixed water charge in monthly instalments. \nVolumetric charge per 1,000 litres of water - Town to tank connection customers will be billed for their water use every second month based on actual water meter reads. Standard connection customers will be billed every month for their water use based on alternating actual and estimated water meter reads.\nWhat type of water meter and backflow device will be installed?\nOnce your application has been approved and you have paid your bill, we will install the following outside your property:\nA 15mm water meter with a tag identifying it as a low-flow meter\nA testable backflow device\nHow do I connect to a town to tank connection?\nYou will need to engage a registered plumber to complete the installation on \nyour side of the water meter.\n Their work will need to comply with the Building Act as well as the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act. You may choose to run a pipe up to your rain tank or you may choose to install a tap inside your boundary, enabling you to run a hose as required.\nImportantly, we need you to ensure that the hose or pipe used to top-up your tank is not submerged in the rainwater. There needs to be an air gap of at least 25mm between the hose or pipe and the highest overflow level.\nHow do I operate a town to tank connection?\nYou are responsible for installing and operating the plumbing on \nyour side of the water meter.\nImportantly, we need you to ensure that the hose or pipe used to top-up your tank is not submerged in the rainwater. There needs to be an air gap of at least 25mm between the hose or pipe and the highest overflow level.\nWe also suggest you:\nBury your private pipe to avoid the sun heating the water.\nFlush water through the pipe before topping up your tank – this is to remove the water that will have been sitting in the pipe since your last top up.\nWhy does a town to tank connection require a backflow prevention device?\nWe must ensure we protect the public network from contamination. The backflow prevention device means water cannot flow from the rain tank into the public network by accident or during a break or network shutdown."

    "url": "https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/what-we-do/water-collection-treatment-and-monitoring/about-our-dams",
    "content": "Where does the water come from?\nThe water comes from protected catchments that are mostly native bush, high up in the ranges. Streams and tributaries feed water to fill the reservoirs created by these dams.\nCatchments\nThe dams only capture water from the upper parts of the catchments. Some of our dams have extensive areas below them which contribute to the total stream or river flows. Occasionally there are extensive storms that do not pass over the part of the catchment above the dam.\nWhat is the difference between water storage dams and hydro-electric dams?\nThe water stored for hydro-electric power passes through a dam to generate power. This water is then discharged to a downstream water course. Hydro-electric dams also have ‘release gates’ to control reservoir levels.\nWater from our reservoirs flows to a water treatment plant, is treated to ensure it is safe to drink, and then carried to consumers. Our dams do not have release gates.\nBenefits from dams\nWhen water is stored in a lake, the quality improves. Sediment settles on the lakebed, and the level of bacteria drops.\nCapturing water during heavy rainfall minimises the likelihood and impact of downstream flooding. When the dams do reach capacity, they are designed to spill into an engineered spillway. When this happens, the volume of water spilling reflects the volume of natural rain falling at that time.\nTo make sure our dams do not adversely affect the downstream environment, we release a small flow of water from each dam to maintain flora and fauna habitats. This ‘compensation flow’ supports the environment when our dams are not full and spilling.\nFree-discharge valves are required for dam safety. We operate the valves periodically to ensure they work correctly, for environmental purposes and to meet resource consent requirements.\nLiving downstream of dams\nDuring heavy rainfall, the dam will provide attenuation to minimise the likelihood and impact of downstream flooding. However, the dam will spill and excess water flows downstream through a spillway as the dam reaches full supply level.\nIf you live downstream of or near to a dam, here are some tips:\nKeep informed on weather reports, and on weather warnings.\nHave a 'Get Ready Get Thru' plan, with an emergency plan and kit.\nCheck our \ndam storage levels\n.\nUnderstand how Auckland Council and the Local Disaster Management Group manage emergency situations in your area.\nSee also: \nRosedale Dam safety information brochure \n             : \nRosedale Dam flow path hazard zone \nHow much water do the Hūnua dams provide?\nOur dams in the Hūnua Ranges are by far the largest. Combined they cover 534 hectares and normally provide 60 per cent of Auckland’s water.\nHow much water do the Waitākere dams provide?\nOur dams in the Waitākere Ranges cover 162 hectares and normally provide 20 per cent of Auckand's water supply.\nHow do our dams compare in size?\nMangatangi is our largest dam. Completed in 1977, it has a lake area of 185 hectares and capacity of 35.3 gigalitres. Upper Mangatawhiri is our second largest dam. It has a lake area of 128.5 hectares and capacity of 16.2 gigalitres.\nIn terms of capacity, Upper Nihotupu Dam holds 2.2 gigalitres and spills into Lower Nihotupu Dam. Waitākere Dam holds 1.76 gigalitres and doesn't spill into another dam, so when it's full we maximise its production.\nSee the current storage of each individual dam here.\nWhy is Waitākere Dam typically one of the first to spill?\nWaitakere Dam is the highest elevated dam, and like Hays Creek Dam it is tiny compared to our biggest dams which are located in the Hūnua Ranges. It spans 25.1 hectares, has a capacity of 1.76 gigalitres and is the smallest dam in the Waitākere Ranges. In 2020, it reached 100 per cent capacity and was spilling. Its size along with the fact it has received more rainfall than other catchment areas are key factors in causing it to spill. When full, in order to reduce the amount of spillage our team maximises production from Waitākere Dam.\nHow much does Hays Creek Dam store?\nHays Creek Dam is tiny compared to our biggest dams Mangatangi and Upper Mangatawhiri. It spans 18.2 hectares and has a capacity of only 1.1 gigalitres. Interestingly, unlike our other catchment areas, it is not a protected catchment. This dam was taken out of service several years ago as it was supplying only a fraction of Auckland's drinking water and was expensive to run. It was reconnected to the metropolitan supply in February 2021, boosting Auckland’s capacity by six million litres a day and by up to 12 million litres a day by August 2023.\nWhy can’t you strategically keep your dams low and prevent them from spilling?\nAuckland’s water supply dams aren’t designed for the rapid drawdown of their water levels and are not suitable for flood management purposes. If they did have the infrastructure to do this, we would lose a significant amount of the city’s water storage capacity and reduce the water available during a drought, which would bring forward the need to invest in new water sources."

    "content": "Treating water from different sources\nOur processes start right at the source. \nAuckland’s water comes from varied sources, including dams, groundwater, springs and rivers. Each treatment plant is designed to deal with the sources of water that feed it. \nThe water from dams in the Hūnua and Waitākere ranges comes from protected areas that are mostly native bush. It requires a relatively low level of treatment to meet water standards.  \nGroundwater typically requires an even lower level of treatment, as the raw water is largely free from bacteria and has very low turbidity (cloudiness). \nThe Waikato River travels through a lot of different environments before the water treatment plant at Tuakau, so it goes through additional treatment processes compared to water from our dams and groundwater.  \nTreating water from our dams    \nMost of Auckland's water comes from dams in the Hūnua and Waitākere ranges. It is treated at four plants: Ardmore, Huia, Huia Village and Waitākere. The treatment process is: \nScreening: water passes through screens that remove any large debris, such as leaves, branches, rubbish and dead insects. \nCoagulation: to remove any dirt that remains, we typically add a compound known as aluminium sulphate (alum) to the water. The alum and dirt particles stick together (coagulate) into large, heavier particles called ‘flocs’. \nClarification: the water is pumped into settling tanks, or clarifiers, where most of the floc settles on the bottom of the tank and is removed. The clarified water is collected from the top of the tank. \nFiltration: the water is forced through sand filters. These trap any remaining particles in the water. \nChlorine disinfection: chlorine is added to kill any germs (micro-organisms), such as E. coli and campylobacter, which might remain after filtration. \nFluoride: fluoride is added to the Auckland metropolitan water supply. Onehunga is an exception; however, this is changing mid-2024 (see note below about the fluoride directive). \nLearn more about fluoride in our water supplies\n. \npH balancing: the final stage is to balance the pH of the water. \nTreating water from the Waikato River \nWater in the Waikato River travels more than 400 kilometres through towns, past farms and industries before it reaches our treatment plant in Tuakau. Runoff from farms and industries that use the water, such as power stations, affects the quality of the water, so we use extra treatment steps such as ultra-filtration to make sure it’s safe to drink.   \nOur ultra-filtration process uses membrane technology: clarified water is pushed through fine membrane filters that prevent tiny micro-organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium from passing though. This makes the Waikato treatment plant one of the most sophisticated in Australasia. \nView our Waikato River water treatment process\n \nLiving near our water treatment plants  \nIf you live near one of our water treatment plants you should know what to do in the case of a chlorine emergency. Admore Water Treatment plant is a special case and has a higher level of safety procedures, including an annual emergency loudspeaker test. \nWhat should I do if there’s a chlorine emergency? \nIn case of a chlorine incident at a water treatment plant, the local community response is to shelter-in-place. This means: \nGo indoors immediately \nClose all doors and windows \nWait for the 'all clear' before going outside \nIf there’s an emergency, you’ll hear our '\nshelter-in-place\n' message, and when it’s safe, you’ll hear our '\nall clear\n' message. \nIn the case of an incident, we work closely with emergency services to coordinate the community. Follow the direction of our staff and/or emergency services. \nLiving near Ardmore Water Treatment Plant\n \nNote that under legislation, the Ardmore Water Treatment Plant at 250 Creightons Road is classed as a major hazardous facility. This means there are strict safety procedures and processes, monitored by WorkSafe, and an annual emergency loudspeaker test.  \nMore information\n. \nThe emergency loudspeaker test occurs once a year for approximately three minutes. As part of our safety planning and review process, we test the loudspeaker to check the tone and message are operating correctly and it can be heard clearly in the area surrounding the plant. \nThe test will sound a tone, followed by: Testing. Testing. Testing. Watercare Test. Testing. Testing. Testing. Watercare Test.” \nListen to the test message\n. \nWatercare labs \nOur labs provide water, air and solids testing for Auckland and the rest of New Zealand. Our lab is accredited by International Accreditation New Zealand to ISO 17025 (general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories). An automated computer network integrated with the labs analyses the water quality at our treatment plants 24 hours a day. \nLearn more\n. \nHow does water pressure management work?\nWe use pressure control valves and monitoring to adjust water pressure in small amounts at points across our network, delivering consistent water pressure levels. \nWhat impacts the pressure in water pipes? \nThings that can impact water pressure in our pipes are: \nThe geography of the area \nThe length of the pipe bringing water from the nearest reservoir to your home/business \nWhere you live: distance and elevation from a reservoir can affect your pressure. Properties in low areas receive higher water pressure and properties in high areas receive lower water pressure. \nDemand: water pressure is usually at its highest during the night when demand is low. When demand is high, which is typically in the morning or evening and during summer months, water pressure is at its lowest."

    "content": "Protecting our native species \nEndangered species like skinks and eels are sometimes found around our construction sites. Our environmental team checks the area, then if needed we relocate at-risk native animals to a safe and healthy spot. We catch them, keep them safe and then invite children from nearby schools to help us release them into a new habitat so they can learn about conservation through action.  \nRestoring Meola Creek \nNorwood Reserve in Mt Albert hides an ecological gem. It’s home to a lava rock forest – a type of native forest that forms on lava flows in the centuries after an eruption. These rare forests now cover less than half a per cent of their pre-European extent, and Norwood Reserve is one of the few in Auckland. \nMeola Creek sits at the edge of the lava rock forest, and our work on the Central Interceptor project offered a great opportunity to help improve the health of the waterway and forest. This led to working with local community groups including St Luke’s Environmental Protection Society and the Albert Eden local board to develop the Waitītiko Meola Creek Enhancement Plan in 2018.  \nDuring our work we’re removing rubbish and weeds to control plants and animal pests in the forest. When the pest plants are cleared, it’ll make room for native trees and shrubs so the forest can regenerate. The plan describes the various improvement activities we’ll undertake in local green areas adjacent to Meola Creek to help improve the health of this important local stream.  \nRead the \nMeola Creek Enhancement plan \n \nCaring for our waterways \nSome of our sites are near parks and waterways, which gives us an opportunity to work with the community on clean ups and planting.  \nOur Lyon Avenue site is partly located within the Roy Clements Treeway on Mt Albert Grammar School grounds, and we’ve worked with the school on environmental projects including two busy planting days.  \nIn another project, we helped the school’s Enviro Club collect seedlings to grow within the construction site. A lot of vegetation was cleared for the work site, so this was an opportunity for students to salvage some self-seeded plants and re-pot them. While the team did the mahi, they heard from Roy Clements about the early days of the Treeway.  \nSome of our other sites border Whau Creek in Blockhouse Bay. To leave our working environment better than we found it, we held a work party to help clean up the banks of the creek. \nPreserving our history \nWe were lucky to discover 3.5-million-year-old fossils in the Kaawa sand dug up at our Māngere site, which raised the interest of Auckland Museum. We’ve now entered a partnership with both Auckland Museum and mana whenua to collect and house taonga discovered during the project.  \nThe museum plans to educate the public about the taonga, both from scientific and cultural points of view. Two paleontologists have come to sift through the stockpile of shell and sand. We’ve made their task easier by splitting the stockpile, providing a loader and a sorting screen normally used in a quarry. \n The museum has collected more than 100 specimens of shell, from small cockle shells to larger oyster and mollusk shells. Some of these shells had never been seen in any Auckland excavations. We’ve also found a whale vertebra, along with various-sized logs and wood fragments, which are thought to be kauri. \nReusing wastewater for construction \nConstruction uses a lot of water, and we’re constantly looking for ways to be more efficient. Our latest initiative is the Māngere Recycled Water Plant. This is a small water reuse plant consisting of two treatment streams. The first stream treats sewage effluent to the standard needed in construction. We aim to produce 500,000 litres per day for use above ground and in the main Central Interceptor tunnel. \nProducing recycled water for construction use has two major benefits: it reduces both the volume of treated effluent being discharged into the Manukau Harbour and reduces reliance on Auckland’s main water supply network. \nThe second treatment stream is a small trial plant to produce treated water for drinking. Our aim is 30,000 litres per day of potable drinking water for testing and analysis. This plant is a first for New Zealand and showcases our aim to be leaders in efficient water use. \n \nSponsoring urban gardens \nWe’re sponsoring \nGrow Space\n in Morningside to help make their urban market garden possible, with a greenhouse, watering system and raised garden beds. Migrant and refugee women are now using the space to develop gardening and business skills. They’re focusing on sustainability and using organic horticulture techniques and have started delivering fresh produce to restaurants in the local area. \n \nElectrifying our truck fleet \nWe’re making our transport greener and quieter with three new electric tipper trucks thanks to $500,000 in funding from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. They’re believed to be the first electric on-road tipper trucks with battery-swapping capability in New Zealand. We’re using them to move excavated rubble and dirt from Central Interceptor shafts and tunnels to refill the old Puketutu Island quarry site in Māngere. \n The e-trucks run on 2800kg batteries with a 200km range. Each battery takes only 5-10 minutes to replace – nearly the same amount of time as refueling a diesel truck. They’ll transport more than 66,000 tonnes of spoil from Central Interceptor sites throughout the project.  \nE-trucks produce 79 per cent less carbon than diesel trucks, which will reduce our project emissions by more than 300 tonnes in total – the equivalent of powering 400 homes for a year.  \nScholarships for Māori and Pasifika \nWe’re committed to recruiting more Māori and Pasifika students who can grow into future business leaders by creating the Ara Tātaki Engineering Pathway Scholarship. This is a partnership between the Watercare Central Interceptor Project and the University of Auckland Faculty of Engineering that gives the recipient funding, mentorship and work opportunities.  \nThe first scholarship has been awarded to Marihi Hōhepa Te Huia, who has iwi affiliation with Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngātiwai. Marihi showed resilience gained through life experience and a deep connection to his culture, community and environment, all qualities we believe will propel him forward as he begins his career in engineering. In the third year of his degree, he works part-time on the Central Interceptor project and will be offered a permanent role upon completion of his studies.\n \nDeveloping a new business with manu whenua\nDirty PPE should be washed in a commercial facility to reduce the risk of spreading harmful substances through the home. With the scale of the Central Interceptor project, we identified the need for a new laundromat and entered a partnership with mana whenua hapū, Te Ahiwaru.  \nNamed Te Whare Manaaki, the laundromat opened for business in November 2021. It launders between 100 and 500 PPE sets a day from our sites. For the marae, this is an opportunity to run a new business and offer work to those who would be otherwise unemployed.  \nSupporting our local schools\nWe’re supporting the 26 schools and kindergartens along the Central Interceptor route through education  programmes. We partner on waterway clean-ups, show students what the project is all about, help them be safe around trucks and work sites, and support community and cultural projects.  \nOne of the local schools created artwork about family activities near streams, lakes and the ocean, and we’ll use these on signs around our sites.  \nWe’ve also teamed up with social enterprise \nMake Give Live\n by purchasing 200 distinctive, bright pairs of slippers to keep the kids at May Road School warm. \n \nSupporting career opportunities with Dig Deep\nIn 2020 we launched the Dig Deep Programme, a weekly two-hour workshop for seven to ten of our staff, running over 20 weeks. The programme builds confidence with important life skills such as English reading and writing, managing money, learning to use technology, and understanding health and safety. The course can also be used to gain a range of qualifications to further their careers.  \nThree of the graduates earned qualifications as a dogman, a key role in construction, responsible for rigging crane loads and safe crane operations."

The document details how the council plans to: \nInvestigate alternative water sources that consider climate change and enhancing te Mauri o te Wai. \nInvestigate energy and carbon inputs for new water supply options (including desalination and wastewater re-use) to inform decision making around new sources. \nModel and monitor climate impacts across the water system. \nIdentify threats to low-lying water and water assets. \nWSAA and Watercare’s commitment \nThe Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA), of which Watercare is a member, has identified risks to water supply and infrastructure along with an increase in the number of hotter days and extended duration of the fire season. To address climate change and its effects, WSAA commits to: \nEngage with customers and communities to achieve a balance across climate change action, costs and outcomes, along with the needs of current and future generations. \nSupport healthy waterways to protect and restore ecological and community values. \nNet zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \nConserve water by reducing water losses and encouraging efficient use of water by our customers. \nImprove water infrastructure resilience, including diversifying water sources and improving treatment processes. \nRecognise the importance of indigenous knowledge and practice in water management. \nImplement circular economy principles in our management of water, waste and energy. \nRead the \nUrban water industry climate change position\n \nTe Rautaki Wai ki Tāmaki Makaurau | Auckland Water Strategy \nThe water strategy commits council whānau to a new relationship with water. It sets out a vision for Auckland's waters and provides strategic direction for investment and action across the Auckland Council group, of which we’re a member. \nAuckland is poised to prioritise a relationship with water centred on understanding and respecting the essential place it has in our lives. This is the driving idea behind the strategy's vision.  \nRead the \nAuckland Water Strategy\n. \nFood and beverage manufacturing  \nThe food and beverage sector is responsible for around a quarter of Auckland’s business water use. The sector provides significant employment and generates revenue for the local economy. We aim to support businesses by offering water audits based on smart data solutions. This data will help manufacturers improve their output for every litre of water used. \nOur commercial customer team is trained to help companies identify water-saving opportunities. If you’re a food and beverage manufacturer and interested in improving your water use, \ncheck out our water-saving tips\n. \nAuckland Council   \nAuckland Council aims to reduce water use by 30 per cent by 2040.  \nWays it's doing this include: \nChanging contracts to make contractors more responsible for water use \nOnly watering public parks when necessary (in some cases installing moisture sensors) \nFixing leaks \nConnecting some public toilets to rain tanks rather than the metropolitan network \nReviewing public pools to determine where water savings are possible \nWe’ve developed “per connection” measurements for council water consumption to support these initiatives.  \nOur FY21 council consumption was 1,050 litres per connection per day. We’ll continue to measure this to ensure year-on-year improvement until 2025. \nEducation \nOur water efficiency programme in schools aims to reduce water use through improved facilities and access to smart data. If your school would like to become more water efficient, \ncheck out our water-saving tips\n. \nDiocesan School in Epsom is reaping the rewards of introducing several water-saving initiatives. Their water use is down and so’s their bill. \nWatch a short video about the measures they've put in place. \nReducing losses\nMost of our water losses are through network leaks. To fix this we need to invest in leak detection and manage pressure in the network. Both activities can be effectively driven by centralised data that identifies the areas we need to focus on. \nImproving oversight from source to tap\nWe’ll continue to build a smarter network from source to tap, enabling proactive leak management and making water use top-of-mind for our customers.  \nCustomers with undetected private leaks will be alerted to them faster, and network leaks can be identified without people needing to report them. \nBuilding a smart network means that we’ll develop a dynamic data model that measures loss across the network at any point in time. Greater data oversight will show us which areas are losing the most water and which assets we need to upgrade or replace. \n \nOptimising pressure in our network \nPipes with over-pressurised water are more likely to break earlier, and leaks in these cases lose a lot more water. Pressure management reduces the instances and severity of leaks in both private and public pipes and helps our assets last longer. \nThrough network intelligence and improved control of water distribution we can achieve more stable (and typically slightly lower) water pressure within the network. Water pressure management is an integral part of our strategy to reduce water wasted throughout the network. \nResidential, community and business water efficiency \nWhile we must play a role in improving the network, Aucklanders need to rise to the challenge, actively pursuing water savings and conserving more water at home, in public places and at work. To achieve our water efficiency goals, we need to work together \nResidential \nWe’re offering residential customers helpful advice on how to save water at home. This includes info on home re-use and water collection systems in partnership with council, iwi and other local organisations. \nResidential water efficiency programme of work: \nProvide resources, advice and research \nSupport Ecomatters and home water checks \nHelp customers use data with smart meters \nBusiness \nWe’re working with businesses to ensure access to the most up-to-date and helpful water-saving advice for their industry and to identify and support new opportunities for water re-use. \nBusiness water efficiency programme of work: \nEngage with top 100 business customers \nWork to promote re-use and recycling of water \nIntroduce complete water audits \nCommunity \nWe’re focusing on public education in partnership with iwi and community groups.

You can also contact them by phone on 09 301 0101.\nApply for a bore water permit \nStep 2: Installing the bore\nOnce permission is granted by Auckland Council it is up to you (the customer) to employ a private contractor to install the bore.\nStep 3: Notifying us\nYour obligation under the \ncustomer contract\nSection (3.1.1) of our customer contract states your responsibility as a customer when installing a water meter: “You are obliged to tell us if you obtain water from an alternative source in whole or in part for your property. If you have an alternative source, we may adjust your wastewater charges to better reflect how much you actually discharge or how much you are calculated by us to discharge.”\n Once Council has approved your water permit and the bore is installed by your contractor, you must find out if you are discharging the bore water to the wastewater network. If you are, you are required to let us know. Unmonitored wastewater discharges can cause overflows which can be detrimental to public health and the environment. We will work with you to understand any capacity constraints in our wastewater network and whether there is any risk of the bore water mixing with our drinking water. To learn more about backflow prevention, click here.\nContacting us could also mean that your wastewater charges are adjusted to better reflect the amount you are discharging. \nWe will work with you to calculate your wastewater use and discuss the following:\nSet up a comprehensive site visit with our team so we can determine the appropriate wastewater discharge.\nMetering option 1: You may be able to install a wastewater meter on your private wastewater network to measure discharge. This option is only suitable to some properties.\nMetering option 2: Install a water meter on your alternate water source (the bore). Readings taken from your water meter would be used to calculate the volume of wastewater entering the network.\nMost customers find that ‘option 2: installing a water meter on the bore’ is the most cost-effective way to calculate the amount of wastewater entering the network.\nWe will let you know if you need to have a water meter fitted onto the bore. If the answer is, yes, you will be required to organise and pay for the meter installation to be fitted by a private contractor of your choice. This is because the work is being done on your side of the network (the private side), It’s important that you inform your contractor or installation company of the requirement to fit a meter.\nHow do I know what meter to install?\nOnly Elster Kent meters are permitted. \nClick here for our guidelines on where to install the meter.\n How do I know what wastewater meter to install?\nMetering wastewater is quite different to metering water, firstly, wastewater meters are privately owned assets which our meter readers will need access to read. Our \ncode of practice\n has more information on wastewater metering criteria and installation guidelines.\nStep 4: What's next\nOnce your bore water meter or wastewater meter is set up, \nclick here to submit your application\n. Once the application is approved, your meter will be added to your account and regularly read by our team.\nNote: We may book in a wastewater audit and make the necessary adjustments to your account. Wastewater audits will need to be carried out every two years."

    "content": "Legislative Framework \nThe legislative framework enabling and governing our operations as the provider of water and wastewater services in Auckland is found largely in four Acts: \nLocal Government Act 2002 \nLocal Government (Tamaki Makaurau Reorganisation) Act 2009 \nLocal Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009 \nLocal Government (Auckland Transitional Provisions) Act 2010 \nMust manage its operations efficiently with a view to keeping the overall costs of water supply and wastewater services to its customers (collectively) at the minimum levels consistent with the effective conduct of its undertakings and the maintenance of the long-term integrity of its assets.  \nMust not pay any dividend or distribute any surplus in any way, directly or indirectly, to any owner or shareholder.  \nIsn’t required to comply with section 68(b) of the Local Government Act 2002 (avoiding the requirement to pay a dividend).  \nMust have regard for public safety in relation to its structures.  \nAlso under the legislative framework: \nWe became a substantive council-controlled organisation (CCO) on 1 July 2012. \nWe must give effect to the council’s Long-Term Plan (LTP) and act consistently with other specified plans and strategies of the council, section 58 of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009. \nAt least two board meetings a year are required to be held in public: one before 30 June to consider the council’s comments on the draft statement of intent (SOI) for the upcoming financial year, and one after 1 July to consider our performance under the SOI for the previous financial year. In practice, all board meetings have a session open to the public. \nOur financial statements, the SOI and specified long-term plans must be audited by the Auditor-General, or by an auditor acting on behalf of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is the auditor of Watercare’s financial statements.  \nWater Supply and Wastewater Network Bylaw 2015 \nThis bylaw serves as a legally binding mechanism that enables us to protect our water supply and wastewater network assets. It replaces Auckland’s eight previous water supply and wastewater bylaws, standardising regulation across the region. \nThe bylaw covers various matters including: \navoiding illegal or inappropriate connection to or disconnection from our network \n​protecting our network from damage, misuse and interference \nrequiring appropriate standards for infrastructure that will be vested as public assets \nenabling the restriction of water supply to maintain an adequate supply of drinking water in a drought or other emergency. \nFurther legislative requirements\nTaumata Arowai – the Water Services Regulator Act 2020: \nUnder this legislation the principal regulators for water quality include Auckland Council, Waikato Regional Council and Taumata Arowai. \nWater Services Act 2021\n: \nThis Act requires all persons who perform or exercise functions, power and duties under the legislation to give effect to Te Mana o Te Wai. These parallels requirements imposed on local authorities under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, and on Taumata Arowai under the Taumata Arowai – the Water Services Regulator Act. In particular, the purpose of the Act is to ensure that drinking water suppliers provide safe drinking water to consumers. New drinking water rules and standards came into effect on 1 July 2022. \nTe Puna (Taumata Arowai): \nAs part of its governance arrangements, Taumata Arowai has Te Puna – Māori Advisory Group that is charged with advising on Māori interests and knowledge as they relate to the objectives, functions and principles of Taumata Arowai. This includes developing and maintaining a framework that provides advice and guidance on how to interpret and give effect to Te Mana o Te Wai and providing advice on how to enable mātauranga Māori, tikanga Māori and kaitiakitanga to be exercised. \nHealth Act 1956: \nSchedule 1AA includes transitional provisions relating to fluoridation of drinking water and aims to protect public health by improving drinking-water qualities in communities. \nHealth and Safety at Work Act 2015\n: \nSets out the principles, duties and rights in relation to workplace health and safety. A guiding principle is that workers and others must reasonably be given the highest level of protection from workplace health and safety risks. \nClimate Change Response Act 2020:\n \nCreates an obligation for us if the Minister or the Commission makes a request for information as provided for at subsection (1). \nResource Management Act 1991\n: \nFocuses on the health of the environment but is soon expected to be repealed and replaced with the Natural and Built Environment Act and Spatial Planning Act."

Look for the orange pop-up on the homepage of this website. If you'd prefer to report the fault over the phone, you can contact us on (09) 442 2222 option 1.\nWhen to report a fault\nAm I being charged for water that's leaking?\nIf water is leaking before it enters your water meter (towards the road) it will not cause a high bill.\nIf the leak is within the meter box, it may cause a high bill. Our crews will do repairs and we may consider adjusting your account. If you believe this applies to you, phone (09) 442 2222, press 2.\nIf the leak is outside the meter box (towards your property) or within your private pipes or fittings, you will need to get a plumber to fix it. When it is fixed, you can \napply for a leak allowance\n to help with the cost (conditions apply).\nFinancial assistance\nIf you don’t have funds readily available to pay for leak repairs, see \nFinancial hardship\n.\nCan I pay Watercare's contractors to fix the pipes on my property?\nUnfortunately not. Our contractors cannot repair the private network because of liability. Any registered plumber in your area can help with your private plumbing.\nCan you reimburse my plumber's invoice?\nWe generally do not reimburse any work done by a private plumber. For more details see the \ncustomer contract\n, section 4.1.\nHowever, there are unique instances where we may reimburse a customer. This is on a case by case basis after our engineers have investigated.\nPhone us on (09) 442 2222, press 2.\nFor emergency water shutdowns, why can't the contractors visit my home to inform me?\nDuring an emergency water shutdown, crews may not have time to door-knock as they want to give all their attention to getting water restored as soon as possible. We understand that this can be inconvenient, but rest assured our crews are working as quickly as possible to restore your water supply.\nHow do I claim a leak allowance?\nFor information and conditions, go to \nApply for a leak allowance\n.\nYou can also apply online using \nMyAccount\n. Click ‘apply for leak allowance’ in the top bar.\nHow quickly will you respond to my problem?\nWe treat every fault with urgency, so prioritising faults is very important. Priority depends on the severity, location, health and safety, and the number of people affected. As a low-cost provider we aim to be efficient in the way we manage our field crew’s workload. The timeframe you want may not always be possible, but we will attend as soon as we can.\nI am a tenant. What do I do about a leak? \nLandlords are responsible for fixing leaks on their property. Ask that they act quickly because you’re paying for the water. See \nHelp for tenants\n.\nIf I have discoloured water, what does it cost to flush the tap for 10 minutes?\nThe cost is around 56 cents, based on the cost of running a shower. We don’t give credits for flushing discoloured water.\nThere is a leak in my private pipeline, but I don't know where it's coming from. What can I do?\nA good first step is to contact a registered plumber. Most plumbers will check the usual areas such as taps and toilets, but may not be able to pinpoint an underground leak right away. A plumber will usually contact a service to help find the leak.\nHow to check for leaks\nThere is a problem with the water supply (no water, strange taste, colour, smell)\nFor help and advice see \nWhen to report a fault\n.\nThere is a problem with the water meter\nFor advice, see \nHow to check for leaks\n.\nOr phone (09) 442 2222, press 1.\nWhat financial assistance is available to help pay for leak repairs on my property?\nIf you don’t have funds readily available to pay for leak repairs, you may seek help from Work and Income .

You can use the same login details\nNot registered for MyAccount? You will need your current bill\nRenting the property? Ask your landlord for permission to access the data in the app\nWhat versions of IOS and Android will support the app?\nThe minimum versions are Android 21 (5.0) and iOS version 11. \nI already use MyAccount, do I need to sign up again for the app?\nIf you are already registered for MyAccount, you can use the same log in information (email and password) to log into the app. Any properties you have added in MyAccount will be visible in the app and vice versa.\nDoes the app and MyAccount look the same?\nThe app and MyAccount have some similar functionalities, but you will only be able to see smart meter data in the app. \nCan I use the app on my laptop?\nNo, this is a mobile only application. You cannot access it on a laptop.\nCan I use the app if I don’t have a smart meter?\nAny of our customers can download and use the app but only smart meter customers with a ‘one meter to one account’ configuration will be able to receive continuous water use and high bill alerts. Customers with one meter servicing multiple dwellings or those with single properties that have multiple meters can still use the app but will have reduced functionality.  \nDoes the app refresh the data daily and at what time?\nThe app receives data from smart meters once a day between 2am and 8am. This data will cover a period from 12am to 12pm. For mechanical meter customers, the usage data is updated based on your billing period.\nCan I pay my bill on the app?\nYes, you can make a one-off payment in the app.\nCan I change my automatic payments on the app?\nNo, you cannot set-up or change any automatic payments using the app. Please use MyAccount.\nWill I be able to set up, amend or cancel direct debits from the app?\nYou will not be able to set up, amend or cancel direct debits from the app. This needs to be carried out via MyAccount.\nCan I see my historical water bills on the app?\nYes, our app has a billing history section that you can use to see your historical water bills and view your billing history. You can also share your bill.\nCan I see my historical water use on the app?\nOver time, depending on when your account was connected or when your meter was installed, you will be able to see up to six years of data.\nMechanical meter customers: You’ll be able to see as far back as 2019 or from the date your account was connected (if that is after 2019). Over time, you’ll see up to six years' of data.\nSmart meter customers: If you’ve had a smart meter installed or recently connected your account to a smart meter, you’ll see your water use data from the date of installation or date of account connection. Over time, you’ll see up to six years' of data.\nMy meter’s been changed from mechanical to smart, can I still see my mechanical meter data?\nOnce a smart meter is installed you will no longer be able to see the data graph from your previous mechanical meter. However, you will still be able to access your mechanical meter readings through your PDF bills which are located in billing history.\nWill the app let me know if I have a leak?\nYou will receive a proactive notification on the app if your smart meter detects continuous water usage at your property as this could indicate a leak. You will be notified after 3, 14 and 25 days of continuous water usage.\nHow do I do a leak test using a smart meter?\n  \nFirstly, in the app, go to \nSettings > Help > Checking for a leak\n to see examples of how continuous usage is displayed.\nTraditional leak test methods can still be used for smart meters.\nPick a time when no water will be used for at least four hours – overnight is a good time. \nRead your water meter, then read it again after the period of not using any water. Make sure you don’t use any water during the test. DO NOT turn off the tap on the meter during the test - you need to be able to see if the meter increases while you are not using water, as this helps indicate a leak. For example, if you do an overnight test, you would read your meter at night before bed, then again first thing in the morning. \nIf the meter numbers are higher, this shows that water is being used and it is likely you have a leak. \nI am a landlord. Can my tenants download the app?\nYes. If you share your latest water bill with them, they can download the app and register. When your tenants move out, you will need to remove their access using MyAccount.\nI own multiple properties with smart meters. Can I see all of them in the one app?\nYes, you can add as many or few properties as you wish.\nMissing random days of data? What's the reason for that?\nYour meter transmits data once a day. If your meter struggles to connect for any reason and we do not receive your usage information we will not be able to display any data for that day. As soon as your meter reconnects, we will receive all missing data and your usage graphs will update automatically.\nHow do I turn haptics off?\nHaptics is only used on the 30-minute graph, and at this stage cannot be disabled.\nI keep getting alerts, how do I turn them off?\nThe only push notifications we send are for potential water leaks. If you wish to turn off that notification, you can do so by going into settings."

It only takes a minute to complete, but you’ll need:  \nthe Watercare account number for the property \nthe legal property owner’s name \nthe property address. \nIf you own multiple properties, you must complete a form for each property you’d like to opt in. \nOnce you’ve opted in, your lump sum payment will roll over each year, so you won’t need to contact us unless you’d like to opt out or are selling your property. \nWhat to expect once you’ve opted in \nYou won’t receive a separate invoice for your lump-sum charge. Instead, we’ll add it to your July invoice, which will be higher than usual as it will include: \nthe monthly volumetric water charge \nthe monthly volumetric wastewater charge \nthe final pro-rata fixed wastewater charge for the previous billing year \nthe fixed wastewater charge for the upcoming year. This is your lump sum payment.  \nany administration charges or account fees.  \nFor the rest of the year (until June), the monthly bill will only include the volumetric water and wastewater charges and any administration charges or account fees. \nImportant: The fixed wastewater charge will appear each year on the July bill. If your tenant chooses to pay the bills by direct debit or credit, you will need to ensure you pay your share of the bill each July.  \nHow to opt out  \nYou can opt out at any time by completing \nthis form\n. You’ll return to paying your fixed water charges monthly, and we’ll credit you with any balance from your lump sum payment. \nCan I opt in if my account is overdue? \nYes, but we recommend you speak to your tenant to ensure the account is paid and up to date before we generate/produce the July bill.\nWhat happens if I sell my property during the period I have paid for? \nIf you have a direct debit, it will continue until you turn it off in MyAccount. If your tenant has a direct debit, you need to pay the wastewater fixed charge, which will appear as a lump sum on the July bill. \nI have opted in and paid my upfront charge. What happens if I sell my property partway through the period? \nIf you sell your property, as part of the settlement process your solicitor will let us know your settlement date. We will use this date to:\ncalculate the pro-rata amount of the annual fixed charge\ncredit that amount to the water account.\nYour solicitors will then get a final invoice for your property as part our standard process. For example: If you sell your house in January (seven months after you paid the full fixed charge in July), you will receive a credit to your account for the pro-rated amount for the year remaining (five months). If your settlement date is July or August, we will automatically \nopt you out \nso that no pro-rata calculation is needed.\n I have paid my lump sum payment. Why are you contacting me for payment when my tenant hasn’t paid their bill? \nThe landlord is still ultimately responsible for ensuring that the water account is paid as our supply contract is with the property owner – see the \ncustomer contract\n. Recovery of any unpaid usage is between the landlord and the tenant and depends on the conditions of the tenancy agreement in place.

    "content": "How does the app know if I have a leak? \nYou’ll need a smart meter at your property. If it detects continuous water usage, you might have a leak. After 3, 14, and 25 days of continuous water use, the app will notify you so you can take action. \nHow accurate is the water usage data? \nThe app receives smart meter data once a day between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m., covering the period from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. If you don’t have a smart meter, the data is based on your billing period. \nI have a smart meter. Where is my old data? \nOnce a smart meter is installed, you won’t see your usage graph from your old mechanical meter. However, you can still find this data on your invoices in your billing history."

    "content": "Step 1: Is the meter-read accurate?\nAlthough we take every precaution, we may have read your meter incorrectly. To check if this has happened, you’ll need to read your meter yourself.  \nWater meters are usually located near or just outside the property boundary. They’re in a box made of wood, plastic, concrete or metal. Here’s how to \nfind and read your meter\n in our residential section. \nCheck that the number on the meter dial is either equal to or slightly higher than the amount on the back of your most recent bill. On a mechanical meter, we bill off the black numbers. On a smart meter, we bill off the numbers before the decimal point. \nIt’s normal to have fluctuations in billed usage compared to your meter reading. This will be corrected on the next billing cycle. If you have a variation of more than 8kls, contact us using our \nonline enquiry\n \nor call as at (09) 442 2222, press 2.\nStep 2: Is this a catch-up bill?\nWe aim to have a meter reader take an actual reading of your meter every two months. In between we use your previous two actual readings to calculate an estimated usage.  \nIf you’ve had several estimated bills in a row due to obstacles like access issues and this is your first actual meter read in some time, that could explain why your bill is higher than usual. On your bill, estimated meter reads are shown on the 'billed usage history' graph with an E – actual reads are indicated with an A.   \nIf the property has a smart meter, your monthly bills reflect the property’s actual water use. You can view the household data in half-hourly, daily and monthly bites via our free app, available at the App Store or on Google Play. If you see water is being used continuously, you are likely to have a leak. \nLearn more about the app\nStep 3: Has the water usage changed?   \nYour bill may be higher if there has been extra people staying or living in the property. Ask yourself the following questions: \nHas there been a long period of time where extra people have been living or staying at the property? \nHave new appliances been installed that use more water? \nHave your tenants used the washing machine or dishwasher more often? More people or greater use of appliances will often lead to a higher bill. \n It’s also normal to use more water in summer than in winter months. The following activities can lead to a higher water bill: \n Watering the garden more often \nLeaving outside hoses or sprinklers on by mistake \nUsing a water blaster \nFilling a swimming pool \nShowering more often \nLandscaping or renovating. \nStep 4: Check for a leak\nIf you've ruled out the above, there may be a water leak on the property. But it’s important to do a leak test before calling in a plumber. Follow the link below for how to check for and manage leaks.  \nHow to check for leaks\nPrivate leaks are your responsibility to fix, whereas leaks on the public network are our responsibility. \nHere’s a diagram of your responsibilities and our responsibilities when it comes to pipes\n. If you find a leak on your property, you’ll need to contact a registered plumber to fix it."

Unlike other utilities such as power or gas, we cannot turn off the service.\nWe supply the service to the property, not to individual tenants. This means that the landlord or property owner must ensure the continuous water supply is paid for.\nWho arranges payment of the bill?\nIt is up to the landlord and tenant to agree on who will pay each part of the bill.\nIf a tenant is paying the usage (volumetric) part of the water bill, landlords should:\nGive the tenant authority to talk to us about bills and payments.\nTo authorise a tenant, contact us:\nPhone (09) 442 2222, press 2\nYou may also want to choose the \none-off fixed charge payment\n (an option for landlords/property managers).\nHow does a property management agreement affect my dealings with Watercare?\nOur contract is with the property owner (the customer). If a customer appoints a project manager and draws up an agreement (PMA), we need a signed copy of it. When dealing with the property manager we can only do what the PMA allows – for instance, requesting a refund or authorising tenants.\nTIP: Before sending us a signed PMA, it would be helpful to send us a draft, so that we can make sure the project manager has the authority we may require.\nCan I pay the fixed wastewater charge annually rather than monthly?\nYes. If you own or manage a tenanted property, you can pay the fixed charge for wastewater as an upfront payment once a year in July.\nLearn more and opt in: \nFixed charge payment\nWho pays the fixed charge – the property owner or property manager?\nIt depends on the arrangement with the property manager, but usually the property manager pays the account in full. Then the owner or tenants pay other charges separately, depending on the agreements they have. See \nPay a fixed annual charge\n.\nWhose name is on the bill?\nThe first and last names of the owner will be printed on the bill. If there are more than three owners of a property the names may not all be printed.\nThe name of any person who is not a legal owner will not be on the bill. This is because the contract is between Watercare and the owner.\nCommercial tenants/lessees\nWhen the bill is sent to a commercial tenant, the owner’s name will be printed on the first line of the postal address. No employee name will be printed on the bill.\nTo change the name on the bill from the owner to the lessee, please complete the \nchange of commercial lease form\n, including the direct debit form.\nIf the request comes from the owner, bills can be sent to a tenant without a completed change of commercial lease form.\nCan I have my bills sent by email?\nYes, you can \nsign up for e-billing.\n You can have bills emailed to multiple addresses, including tenants.\nCan the tenant receive a copy of the bill?\nBills can be sent to a tenant at the owner’s request (by post or email). See\n e-billing\n.\nNo names of tenants will be on the bill.\nThe second line of the postal address will say c/- The Tenant.\nThe owner will have an email copy of the bill sent to them.\nSee also above: Whose name is on the bill?\nHow can I confirm that I have a leak?\nIf you have an unexpectedly high water bill, it may be due to a leak. To learn more, see:\nHigher bill than usual\nHow to check for a leak\nWho pays to repair a leak?\nIt is the property owner's responsibility to fix leaks and pay for any repairs on the private network. See \nWho is responsible for pipes?\nWe recommend you fix leaks as quickly as possible. Not only will it save money and reduce water wastage – if it takes you a long time to fix your leak, it may affect your ability to claim a full allowance.\nHow soon should I apply for the allowance?\nOnce you've been made aware of the leak, you must send the form to us \nwithin three months.\nWhat does the allowance cover?\nThe allowance will be for excess water use compared to your average use calculated from your previous two meter reads.\nIf you have not been at the property for a full year, the typical average daily use will be applied.\nWhen will the allowance take effect?\nWe will process requests within 10 working days of receiving your application, or earlier if possible.\nIf we accept your application, you'll receive a letter stating the allowance amount, how much you have left to pay on your bill and your new due date.\nThe allowance will appear as a credit in the current charges section on your next bill.\nI've fixed a leak. Why is my latest bill still high?\nThe most likely reason is that we alternate actual and estimated meter readings.\nThe chart below shows an example of this scenario. The first high bill due to a leak is in May. The leak is fixed sometime in June or July, but there is a second high bill in July. \nThe estimate in June is significantly lower as it is based on the last two normal actual reads (January and March).\nThe July bill is still higher than usual because it has recorded the rest of the leak between receiving the May bill and when it was fixed (sometime between the June and July bills).\nView an example of this on a bill\n.\nIf you think this situation applies to you, please contact us so we can consider a further allowance. Phone: (09) 442 2222, press 2.\nCan I get a refund if my account goes into credit due to a leak allowance?\nIf you want a refund, please complete and send the \nform to request a refund\n.\nIn some situations, such as when a tenant is seeking a refund, we may ask you to provide receipts as proof of who made the initial payments to us.\nI am a commercial customer. Can I apply for the allowance?\nYes, but the allowance will be for wastewater charges only.\nCan I get an allowance for another leak?\nIf you have another leak within two years of receiving the allowance, you may send a new application. You must attach a plumber’s invoice.\nNote: the allowance for a second leak will only be for excess wastewater charges."

    "content": "What is a Watercare compliance statement?\nA document that confirms that the design or construction works have been completed in accordance with our standards.\nWhy do I need to provide Watercare with a compliance statement?\nThe statement is a way to ensure work is completed to a consistent standard across all assets that we manage. Without proof that the minimum standards are met, we will not accept assets vested to us, or to be connected to any Watercare asset.\nWho completes the statement?\nThe statements are completed by subject matter experts who are proficient in their field. Proficiency is based on minimum levels of academic qualifications and competency, as assessed by an independent registration board or organisation.\nWhat qualifications must I have to submit a statement?\nFor design work the person must have suitable design qualifications and experience. For construction works a person must be qualified to perform certain tasks such as plastic pipe welding or drainlaying. \nWhat registration board or professional body do I need to belong to?\nWe list recognised registration boards in the compliance statement guidelines. Registration with a board must be appropriate to demonstrate competency in your practice area.\nHow do you select the registration boards?\nRegistration boards must evaluate or screen membership to ensure the member demonstrates competency in the industry and practice area. The board should hold their members to account and require that they adhere to a code of conduct or ethics. The boards are local to New Zealand, or where international agreement terms between registrars exist. \nWhat if the board I belong to is not recognised?\nWe will accept alternative registrars where it can be shown that inter-organisational agreements exist.\nAlternatively an equivalent qualified person with recognised registration must review your work and provide a compliance statement in review (design) or instead of the originator (construction).\nWhat happens if I do not provide a compliance statement?\nThe design or constructed assets will not be accepted for vestment to Watercare.\nWhich works require a compliance statement?\nCompliance statements are required for all engineering works. The statements are hold points between design and construction, and construction and connection.\nThe progressive points where we require statements are:\ncompletion of the final design (CS1/CS2)\ncomponents or stages of construction to allow staged commissioning (CS3/4)\nor at the end of the construction work (CS3/4).\nWhat evidence do I need to provide with the construction statements?\nFor construction works you must supply:\nthe test certificates and quality control aspects as required by our standards, with\ncomplete sets of as-built drawings and asset registers, operational manuals and commissioning reports.\nWhat evidence do I need to provide with the design statements?\nIt depends on the type of work. In terms of design some works may require additional reports such as geotechnical reports, but process works at plants may not. At a minimum a comprehensive design report that includes the basis for design, calculations, proposed construction monitoring levels and material selection. The design drawings need to be in final format and the designer needs to show that Safety in Design principles have been followed.\nWhat are the consequences of signing a statement and what am I liable for?\nBy certifying work you take responsibility for it complying with our standards. If misconduct or negligence is proven, we will pursue damages  and report any misconduct to the registration board, with the aim of revoking membership and thereby preventing future work on our assets.\nWhen will my statement not be accepted?\nCommon reasons could include an inappropriate level of qualification, incorrectly completed statements or incomplete evidence. The compliance statement guidelines set out the full conditions of acceptance.\nCan I use an IPENZ producer statement for Watercare works?\nOnly if the works are in relation to the building code and an IPENZ producer statement is required for consent purposes. IPENZ producer statements cannot be used for demonstrating compliance with Watercare’s standards. Likewise, the Watercare compliance statements cannot be used for supporting building consent applications.\nWho does the IGC charge apply to?\nThe IGC applies to all property owners or developers applying for new connections to our networks are liable for the IGC.\nExamples include:\nConnecting a new property to our network\nConnecting a new dwelling on an existing property\nIt also applies to existing commercial customers who increase demand for water and wastewater.\nApply to increase demand\nWhen is the IGC applied?\nThe IGC is applied whenever a property owner or developer adds extra demand on our networks. Typically, this occurs when:\nA new property connects to our network\nA new habitable dwelling on an existing property connects to our networks. If the dwelling is less than 65 sqm or less, you may be eligible for a reduced rate\nAn existing commercial property increases (or expects to increase) its water use. \nHow much is the IGC?\nView current IGCs\nCharges vary for stand-alone non-metropolitan networks where past and future investments are specific to each network. These investments are divided by the capacity created to determine the IGC. Each investment will be different, depending on the scale and timing of development and how we provide the service.\nHow is the IGC calculated?\nTo calculate the charge, we follow these steps:\nWe consider the amount we will invest in growth-related infrastructure over a 15-year period (four years historical, current year, 10 years forward)\nWe divide the amount we expect to invest in growth-related infrastructure by the number of properties we expect to connect\nWhen our current customers pay for their water and wastewater services, they are paying for three components: operating costs, depreciation and finance costs. This step is to calculate the net present value of the depreciation and finance portion of money we will receive from water and wastewater charges over an average asset life\nWe reduce the total cost of delivering growth-related infrastructure to a property by the net present value of future interest and depreciation payments, paid through ongoing water and wastewater charges. This ensures the developer is not charged twice for the same asset\nHowever, currently we only charge a portion of the cost of growth-related infrastructure rather than the full amount that can be recovered by an IGC. Our intention is to increase our IGC over time to recover more of the cost of growth-related infrastructure from the growth community. We recognise the need to balance our intention to align the costs and benefits of growth-related investment with the broader public good it generates.\nWho pays the IGC?\nThe person or organisation that owns the property at the time the demand for services (new or additional) is required is responsible for paying the IGC.\nIf you employ someone to build your house, you are still responsible for paying the IGC as you own the land when it is being developed.\nWhat is a Development Unit Equivalent (DUE)?\nA Development Unit Equivalent (DUE) is the unit of demand we use to calculate IGCs. For water supply, one DUE is 220 kilolitres of water use per year. For wastewater, one DUE is 209 kilolitres of wastewater discharge per year. For example, if a property connects to our network for the first time and they estimate their water demand to be 2,200 kL/year, this equates to 10 DUEs.\nWhat is a baseline?\nA baseline (or baseline demand) is the level of annual demand that a commercial property is entitled to use over a 12 month period. If this baseline is exceeded, you may incur additional IGCs relative to your increase in demand above this baseline.\nEvery commercial property connected to our water and/or wastewater has a unique baseline. To find out how baselines are determined, refer to \nPage 8 of our customer contract\n.\nDo I have to pay an IGC if I've paid a development contribution?\nYou will not be charged an IGC if you have paid a water and wastewater development contribution to the council.\nIGCs were introduced on 1 July 2011. If you paid a development contribution to the council before then, it may have provided for water and wastewater infrastructure. This means you will not have to pay an IGC unless the scale or intensity has increased since the original contribution was paid.\nWhen you apply to us for a new connection, we ask if you believe a development contribution has been paid. We will confirm with the council whether a development contribution that covers water and wastewater infrastructure has been paid in the past.\nIs the IGC a connection charge?\nNo. A connection charge covers the cost of our crew visiting your property and connecting your pipes to ours.\nCan I set up a payment arrangement for an IGC?\nWe will require full payment from most customers before we provide a connection. However, for developers who are building on a large scale with staged developments we can consider staged payments.\nIs the IGC refundable?\nAn IGC is not refundable but it doesn’t disappear either. If you’re redeveloping a site and demolish part or all of the existing buildings, any IGC or development contribution for water and wastewater paid previously (even by the previous land owner) will be used as a credit towards the redevelopment.\nOnce I've paid the IGC, do I have to pay it again?\nThe IGC is a one-off charge unless you intend to use more water or connect more dwellings to our network.\nFor example, if you have a factory and increase your water use, you will need to pay an IGC to cover the increased demand that your factory puts on our infrastructure (even if you don’t need a new connection).\nWill I pay less if I install a rainwater tank?\nIf only wastewater services are available on your street and you have to install a rainwater tank, you will be charged a wastewater only IGC. \nYou can find the IGC applicable to you here.\nIf both water and wastewater services are available on your street, you will be charged the full IGC regardless of installing a rainwater tank. While you may think a rainwater tank will reduce demand on our network, unfortunately it does not reduce the money we must invest in infrastructure. We have to provide infrastructure to accommodate peak demand. Typically, this occurs when rainwater tanks are empty and people rely on our supply – either through their own mains connection or through water tanker operators who source their water from us.\nWill I pay less if I only connect to one network (water or wastewater)?\nIf both the water and wastewater networks are available in your street, you will be required to pay a full IGC.\nIf only the water or wastewater network is available in your street, you will be required to pay for the service that is available. In the metropolitan area this is half the standard IGC.\nWill I pay less if I build a residential unit?\nYou may be eligible for a reduced rate if you are building a residential unit that is less than 65 square metres.\nWill I pay less if I build a ‘green’ building?\nIf you are a commercial customer your IGC will be calculated on the volume of water you expect to use. Therefore, if you install water saving devices that will reduce your water demand, it will reduce your IGC.\nWill I be charged an IGC if I am building infrastructure to vest to Watercare?\nYes, the IGC contributes towards the capital investment of bulk infrastructure. These are not the assets which are built to reticulate developments or to connect developments to Watercare’s existing networks.\nWhen was the IGC introduced?\nIn November 2010, the city and district councils across the Auckland region merged into one; Auckland Council. As part of this amalgamation, Watercare took on the management of water and wastewater services for Auckland. The IGC was introduced in 2011 to replace the charges and rates charged by the former councils or their water suppliers to cover the costs of bulk infrastructure investment.\nWhy has the IGC changed?\nWhen Watercare took over charging for Auckland’s water and wastewater services in 2010, we inherited a pricing regime which did not reflect the true costs to cover Auckland’s development and growth.\nWatercare’s only funding sources are from customer charges so we must recover all our costs. The IGC to connect to our services should reflect the cost we incur for providing that service. Since 2010, we have been progressively shifting the cost of growth to IGC, rather than seeing larger increases in the water and wastewater charges for all our existing customers.\nWhat is bulk infrastructure?\nBulk infrastructure refers to treatment plants, large pump stations and transmission pipes.\nCan I ask for the IGC to be reconsidered?\nYes.  You can request that we reconsider the IGC you have been charged. You can also lodge an objection to the IGC you have been charged, which will be heard by independent IGC Commissioners.\nRead the Charter for Commissioners.\nYou cannot use an objection to challenge the content of the IGC terms and conditions. \nClick here for our customer contract.\nRequesting a Reconsideration or Objection factsheet\nDownload Request a Reconsideration or Objection form\nWhat are the implications for properties with laundromats?\nIGCs are assessed for properties with laundromats under the same process as any other commercial customer. However, operating a laundromat can cause significant increases to annual water demand. That’s why we’ve made improvements to our process to ensure a fair outcome for our customers and the industry. \nClick here to find out more information about IGCs for laundromats.\nI am planning a development. How do I find out if any restrictions apply to the area?\nWe need to check Auckland Council-approved building consent plans and other assessments reports before and after you build the development. See \nConsents.\nDo I have to apply for Works Over approval even for small jobs?\nFor any kind of development or construction within 2 metres of public pipes you need Works Over approval. Our engineer will review your proposed development and the condition of the line, and if it’s the case, a dispensation may be given. See \nAbout Works Over\n.\nWhat is the vesting process and what should I do?\nVesting is a conversion of private pipes into public assets, transferring the ownership to Watercare. You need to go through \nAuckland Council\n for this process.\nWill I have to pay the infrastructure growth charge for my proposed development?\nThe IGC is applied whenever a property owner or developer adds extra demand on our networks. Typically, this occurs when:\na new property connects to our networks\na new habitable dwelling on an existing property connects to our networks\nan existing commercial property increases (or is expected to increase) its water use.\nSee \nInfrastructure Growth Charge\n.\nCan I use the proposed design for the water/wastewater connection?\nPlease refer to our \nengineering standards\n.\nDoes Watercare connect my wastewater pipe to the public network?\nAfter we have approved your application, you can engage a registered drainlayer to make the connection to our network. \nConnecting wastewater pipes\n \nI've moved house. Do I need to get the water connected?\nNo – when you move into an existing property, you don’t need to contact us to have your water or wastewater connected. Water and sewerage services are never switched off.  \nWhen will my water meter be installed/relocated/disconnected?\nWhen we receive the full payment, we schedule your job and aim to deliver the service within 15 working days. There may be a delay if there are site constraints. Please contact the engineer in charge of your application if there is a problem or unusual delay.\nWhy have I not received the invoice for my application?\nSometimes our emails may go into your junk/spam email folder. Please check this or contact us to request an update: call (09) 442 2222 or email \n[email protected]\n."

If necessary, use the measuring tool to estimate how close your work will be to our assets. \nWhat ‘near to our assets’ means \nThe requirements and definitions for works near a Watercare asset are set out in Section 8 of the \nAuckland Council Water Supply and Wastewater Network Bylaw 2015. \nCritical and non-critical assets \nOur pipeline assets are divided into two groups – critical and non-critical.  \nCritical assets include:  \ntransmission network pipes of any size \nwastewater rising mains of any size  \nlocal network pipes 300mm diameter or greater. \nNon-critical pipeline assets include all other local network pipes less than 300mm in diameter, except rising mains. \n \nWithin 10 metres of a critical asset \nDo not build over chambers, valves, manholes, rising mains and connections. \nDo not CCTV transmission pipes. \nMark out critical pipes. You may either spear and pothole or hydro excavate to locate the pipe. Apply for \nan investigation approval\n before starting any work. \nIf it is not practical to spear and pothole to locate the pipe, get a registered surveyor to mark it out. You will need to pay for this. \nFor health and safety reasons, only approved third parties may access our networks. \nDesign structural foundations to ensure that any affected pipe bears no additional loading.  \nPlease refer to our  \nCode of Practice\n and \nStandard Drawings \nfor the minimum clearances from our assets, bridging details and piling requirements.  \nYou might need an engineering report depending on the proposed development, depth and condition of the pipe. These requirements are also applicable to a retaining wall or fence. \nYou’ll find all inspections and stand-over requirements in the approval conditions. \nFinal sign-off will depend on the results of the specified inspections and stand-over. This is an Auckland Council requirement. \nWithin two metres of a non-critical asset \nDo not build over chambers, valves, manholes, rising mains and connections. \nYou’ll need a pre-construction CCTV inspection and a permit for \naccessing our wastewater network\n. Please submit the CCTV footage and permit when you lodge your Works Over application. These must be current.  (No older than six months). \nIf you’re building over a pipe that’s damaged or in poor condition, you’ll need to repair it at the applicant's expense.  Works Over approval will come with conditions detailing the remedial action necessary. \nAffected pipes must be clearly marked out. This can be done by the CCTV contractor during the inspection or marked out by a registered surveyor at the applicant’s expense. \nFor health and safety reasons please note only approved third parties may access our networks. \nDesign structural foundations to ensure that any affected pipe bears no additional loading.  \nPlease refer to our \nCode of Practice\n and \nStandard Drawings \nfor clearances from our assets, bridging details and piling requirements.    \nYou’ll need to carry out a post-construction CCTV inspection to ensure the affected pipe has not been damaged. \nFinal sign-off will depend on the results of the specified inspections and stand-over. This is an Auckland Council requirement. \nMinimum cover requirements \nThe minimum cover required over transmission network pipes is: \n1500mm for new carriageway and existing carriageway reinstatements \n900mm in berms and footpaths. \nThe minimum cover required over local network pipes is:  \n900mm for new carriageway and existing carriageway reinstatements \n600mm in berms and footpaths. \nIf either of these minimum cover requirements are not achievable, please contact us on (09) 442 2222 or email \n[email protected]\n \nRegulations and guidelines \nThere are regulations and guidelines for safe working practices, and penalties for carrying out unauthorised work. You’ll find these here. \nHealth and Safety in Employment Act 1992  \nLocal Government Act 2002 and 2009 \nThe Utilities Access Act 2010, and its related Code of Practice \nDepartment of Labour - “Guide for Safety with Underground Services” \nRegardless of whether you are applying for works on private or public land, it's very important that the following points are adhered to when completing your application. Sticking to these requirements makes it easier for our team and eliminates some of the back-and-forth nature of the process. \n \nComplete a Works Over request for final sign-off and Code of Compliance  \nAuckland Council requires Works Over final sign-off from us before processing the Code of Compliance for any property where a structure is built near and/or over our assets. \n When applying for a final sign-off all construction works on site must be fully completed. \nYou’ll need to submit the following to \n[email protected]\n:\n A completed network Works Over inspection report and as-built drawings signed by a certified structural engineer.  \nDownload and complete the inspection report\n. Please refer to the initial Works Over approval letter. \nFinal CCTV inspection of the affected wastewater network. Please do not do a final CCTV inspection until all the works are fully completed.  If your CCTV footage is done beforehand, we cannot approve the final sign-off. Final CCTV must not be older than one month at the time of the final sign-off application.\nPhotos of the completed works including but not limited to: street view images showing the house structure, fences/retaining walls, driveways and landscaping.\nCertificate of Acceptance (CoA) for any work and/or new water and wastewater assets installed as part of this development."

In some cases, the clean septic system may be able to be used for on-site stormwater management. You can discuss this with your plumber/drain layer and Auckland Council.\nWill I need to install a wastewater pump?\nFor most properties, the wastewater vacuum pit can be connected to via a gravity pipeline from the house. There may, however, be some situations where a pump is required. This should be identified by your plumber or drain layer and included in your estimate.\nCan I connect to the water network without connecting to the wastewater network?\nNo. We do not allow water connections if you haven't got a wastewater connection set up by us.\nI currently have a rain tank, what are my options for connecting to the water network?\nThere are several options available:\n1. Connect to the public water network and decommission your rain tank(s). This often frees up additional property space.\n2. Connect to the public water network and retain the rain tank on a separate pipeline for garden watering purposes. For this option, the rain tank must be on a separate isolated plumbing system.\n3. Connect to the public water supply and use it to top up your rain tank. You will require an additional rain tank meter to ensure that wastewater is calculated correctly.\nWhat happens to my stormwater if I no longer have a rain tank?\nWhen full, rain tanks provide little in the way of stormwater attenuation and water will overflow. Rain tanks can be left and used for stormwater attenuation if required or stormwater can be directed to the ground. You can talk with your plumber and drainlayer as well as Auckland Council if further on-site stormwater management work is proposed.\nWhat do I do now?\nStep 1: Contact us\nApplications have opened so you can \napply now\n.\nOur connections team will check to ensure you have been provided with an indicative wastewater pit map. If not, our developer services engineer will contact you and provide an indicative plan for wastewater pit locations. This plan will assist you and your plumber in understanding the connection point from your property. If required, one of our developer services engineers can meet with you and your plumber/drainlayer to discuss.\nStep 2: Contact a plumber\nYou should organise to meet your plumber/drainlayer at your property to discuss making a connection to the public network and decommissioning your water and/or wastewater system.\nFollowing that visit, you should be able to determine the private costs for the works required to connect to the Clevedon network. Please note: The Building Act requires that all private work be carried out by licensed practitioners.\nYou can search for a registered plumber and drainlayer by visiting local directories or searching online. Contractor certification can be checked by asking to see their practice licence or by searching the public register at https://www.pgdb.co.nz/\nTalk to your plumber about the timing of your private works and connections.\nStep 3: Obtain a quote\nThe next step is to obtain a quote from your plumber and drainlayer for internal works associated with your connection.\nIf you're not ready to apply but would like more information, simply email our connections engineer on \n[email protected]\n and we will be in touch to answer your questions.\nWhich properties are not eligible to apply?\nThe local network infrastructure that has recently been constructed has been largely funded by local developers and landowners. This work is nearing completion enabling us to open applications for connections in Clevedon. While service will be enabled for a significant portion of Clevedon Village, some areas will not be able to connect during this initial livening of services. Mark Williams Place, Thorps Quarry Road and Twilight Road (with the exception of 2 Twilight Road, 1 Thorps Quarry Road) are not included in the current scope of works. In future, if there is further development in the area we will notify you."

When can I do this?\nProperties south of the river in live-zoned land will be able to connect to the wastewater network when the new Snells Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant is operational. This is expected to be in mid to late 2025.\nWe recommend you get in touch with us to discuss your development before you start your resource consent process. \nI want to build a new home north of the river. When can I do this?\nThe area north of the river is subject to an additional constraint as there is limited capacity in the existing wastewater network to service growth. This is separate to the capacity issue at the wastewater treatment plant, and therefore it won’t be alleviated as soon as the Snells Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant is operational.\nA new north-west growth servicing pipeline – currently in the planning phase – will alleviate growth restrictions in north Warkworth. Unfortunately, at this stage we do not have a firm construction completion date for this project.\nAuckland Council may still grant resource consents, but with conditions that mean development cannot connect to the wastewater network until our new treatment plant in Snells Beach is operational and the north-west growth servicing pipeline is completed.\nWe recommend you get in touch with us to discuss your development before you invest significant time and money in the resource consent process.\nI’ve got resource consent but I haven’t got building consent. Can I still connect?\nWe will be honouring all commitments made through existing resource consents and building consents. You will still be able to connect when you are ready, provided all relevant consent conditions have been met.\nI’ve already applied for building consent but haven’t yet heard back. What does this mean for me?\nAnyone with a resource consent and the current commitment of a public wastewater connection is not impacted by the temporary pause in new connections. It will not impact your building consent application. If building consent is granted, you will still be able to connect to the wastewater network when you are ready, provided all relevant consent conditions have been met.\nI’m planning to lodge resource consent later this year. What does this mean for me?\nWe recommend you get in touch with us before starting the resource consent process. Timings for available wastewater connections are largely dependent on the location of your proposed development. For example, the area north of the river is reliant on the delivery of the north-west growth servicing pipeline, which is still in the planning phase and doesn’t yet have a firm completion date.\nIf your proposed development is south of the river in live-zoned land, Auckland Council may still grant resource consent, but for the near future these will include a condition that no connection can be made until our Snells Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant is available.\nIf your proposed development is north of the river in live-zoned land, Auckland Council may still grant your resource consent, but with conditions that mean you cannot connect to the wastewater network until our new treatment plant in Snells Beach is operational and the north-west growth servicing pipeline is completed. \nWhen will you have firm plans for the north-west growth servicing pipeline?\nWe hope to confirm the intended route for the pipeline in mid 2024.

    "url": "https://www.watercare.co.nz/business/accounts/apply-for-a-wastewater-audit",
    "content": "How do I decide if I need an audit? \nAll business water meters are given an ‘industry type’ based on the main activity on the water meter. Each industry type has a wastewater percentage. This represents the proportion of water usage that is charged for volumetric wastewater services. \nIf you believe that your actual percentage of wastewater discharge varies from the value on the chart, you may wish to apply for a wastewater audit. If the variation is less than 5 per cent from the standard, we may not agree to a change. \nWhat is the audit based on?  \n There are three types of audits: \nRecipe-based: where the water is used as part of a final product, e.g. making beverages. \nWater-check meter: where the water is used in operations but is not discharged to the wastewater networks, e.g. irrigation or cooling towers. \nA combination of these. \n \nHow long does an audit take?   \nIt can vary – anywhere from a few days up to a year. It depends on your production processes and seasonal variations, such as irrigation during summer. \nHow much will the audit cost me, and how do I pay? \nFor our standard audit fee for a minimum of 2 hours, see \nOther charges\n. \nAudits needing more detailed analysis may take more than 2 hours. In this case we will discuss all costs with you before proceeding with the audit. \nIf we decide not to proceed with an audit, there will be no fee. \nIf you choose to install a check meter or wastewater meter to do periodic flow monitoring, you will be responsible for any costs and maintenance of these meters. \nWe charge the audit fee to your Watercare account when the audit is done. \nWhat happens after the audit? \nIf you are satisfied with the proposed percentage, sign and return the final wastewater declaration form. The new revised wastewater charge will take effect from your next billing cycle and will be shown, with the audit fee, on your next invoice. \nIf we don't hear back from you within 30 days of receipt of the declaration form, we will revert your wastewater percentage to the standard percentage associated with your industry type. \nHow long does the percentage stay current? \nIt's valid for a maximum of two years and will then be reviewed. The review could be earlier if there are changes on the site. \nCan you reassess my business if it changes? \nWe generally review all wastewater percentages after two years. However, if your wastewater volume changes before your two-year review, please contact us to review your wastewater percentage.  \nThere is a fee for all reassessments. \nIf you move premises, we’ll need to re-evaluate the wastewater percentage at your new site. \nFor more information or help, contact us: Phone (09) 442 2222 option 2 or email \n[email protected]\n."

You can use the same login details\nNot registered for MyAccount? You will need your current bill\nRenting the property? Ask your landlord for permission to access the data in the app\nWhat versions of IOS and Android will support the app?\nThe minimum versions are Android 21 (5.0) and iOS version 11. \nI already use MyAccount, do I need to sign up again for the app?\nIf you are already registered for MyAccount, you can use the same log in information (email and password) to log into the app. Any properties you have added in MyAccount will be visible in the app and vice versa.\nDoes the app and MyAccount look the same?\nThe app and MyAccount have some similar functionalities, but you will only be able to see smart meter data in the app. \nCan I use the app on my laptop?\nNo, this is a mobile only application. You cannot access it on a laptop.\nCan I use the app if I don’t have a smart meter?\nAny of our customers can download and use the app but only smart meter customers with a ‘one meter to one account’ configuration will be able to receive continuous water use and high bill alerts. Customers with one meter servicing multiple dwellings or those with single properties that have multiple meters can still use the app but will have reduced functionality.  \nDoes the app refresh the data daily and at what time?\nThe app receives data from smart meters once a day between 2am and 8am. This data will cover a period from 12am to 12pm. For mechanical meter customers, the usage data is updated based on your billing period.\nCan I pay my bill on the app?\nYes, you can make a one-off payment in the app.\nCan I change my automatic payments on the app?\nNo, you cannot set-up or change any automatic payments using the app. Please use MyAccount.\nWill I be able to set up, amend or cancel direct debits from the app?\nYou will not be able to set up, amend or cancel direct debits from the app. This needs to be carried out via MyAccount.\nCan I see my historical water bills on the app?\nYes, our app has a billing history section that you can use to see your historical water bills and view your billing history. You can also share your bill.\nCan I see my historical water use on the app?\nOver time, depending on when your account was connected or when your meter was installed, you will be able to see up to six years of data.\nMechanical meter customers: You’ll be able to see as far back as 2019 or from the date your account was connected (if that is after 2019). Over time, you’ll see up to six years' of data.\nSmart meter customers: If you’ve had a smart meter installed or recently connected your account to a smart meter, you’ll see your water use data from the date of installation or date of account connection. Over time, you’ll see up to six years' of data.\nMy meter’s been changed from mechanical to smart, can I still see my mechanical meter data?\nOnce a smart meter is installed you will no longer be able to see the data graph from your previous mechanical meter. However, you will still be able to access your mechanical meter readings through your PDF bills which are located in billing history.\nWill the app let me know if I have a leak?\nYou will receive a proactive notification on the app if your smart meter detects continuous water usage at your property as this could indicate a leak. You will be notified after 3, 14 and 25 days of continuous water usage.\nHow do I do a leak test using a smart meter?\n  \nFirstly, in the app, go to \nSettings > Help > Checking for a leak\n to see examples of how continuous usage is displayed.\nTraditional leak test methods can still be used for smart meters.\nPick a time when no water will be used for at least four hours – overnight is a good time. \nRead your water meter, then read it again after the period of not using any water. Make sure you don’t use any water during the test. DO NOT turn off the tap on the meter during the test - you need to be able to see if the meter increases while you are not using water, as this helps indicate a leak. For example, if you do an overnight test, you would read your meter at night before bed, then again first thing in the morning. \nIf the meter numbers are higher, this shows that water is being used and it is likely you have a leak. \nI am a landlord. Can my tenants download the app?\nYes. If you share your latest water bill with them, they can download the app and register. When your tenants move out, you will need to remove their access using MyAccount.\nI own multiple properties with smart meters. Can I see all of them in the one app?\nYes, you can add as many or few properties as you wish.\nMissing random days of data? What's the reason for that?\nYour meter transmits data once a day. If your meter struggles to connect for any reason and we do not receive your usage information we will not be able to display any data for that day. As soon as your meter reconnects, we will receive all missing data and your usage graphs will update automatically.\nHow do I turn haptics off?\nHaptics is only used on the 30-minute graph, and at this stage cannot be disabled.\nI keep getting alerts, how do I turn them off?\nThe only push notifications we send are for potential water leaks. If you wish to turn off that notification, you can do so by going into settings."

Problem substances can be harmful if they are not removed before they enter the network.\nTrade waste does not include wastewater from toilets or bathrooms (domestic wastewater).\nWho produces trade waste?\nTypical industries, trades and businesses include: food processors, restaurants, cafes, hospitals, dentists, laundries, hairdressers, metal finishers, service stations, freezing works, ships. For a more comprehensive list, see the \nAuckland Trade Waste Bylaw 2013\n: Schedule 1 and Schedule 2.\nWhy do we manage trade waste?\nIt is important to manage trade wastewater correctly, to prevent:\nsewer blockages or spills\ndamage to the wastewater system\nhealth hazards for people\nharm to the environment.\nWe work with business customers to identify their level of risk, to help them understand their obligations and to assist them to comply at the lowest possible cost.\nWe also make regular site visits to monitor our customers, networks and treatment plants.\nKnow your classification\nWhat are the requirements for my business?\nThe requirements you need to meet will vary depending on how your business activity is classified: low risk or trade waste agreement required. \nCheck your classification\n.\nLow risk: If your business activity is low risk, e.g. a lawyer’s office, your business activity does not need a trade waste agreement.\nTrade waste agreement required: If you discharge liquid waste that is not classified as low risk, you need a trade waste agreement. Learn more: \nTrade waste agreements\nWhether your waste is either low risk or not, you must comply with:\nAuckland Trade Waste Bylaw 2013\nThese are the region-wide rules for the management, regulation and risk classification of trade waste. \nDownload the bylaw\nTrade waste control 2019\nThese standards set out the limits on the concentrations of commonly controlled substances that may be in trade waste entering the public wastewater system. \nDownload the standards\nApply for a trade waste agreement\nIf you are discharging wastewater that is not classified as low risk, you will need an agreement with us. This will set out the controls and monitoring we require to be in place, to assure us that your trade waste discharge is safe to receive into our wastewater network.\nApply for an agreement\nIf your waste is classified as low risk, you don't need an agreement.\nMonitor your waste\nMost customers who hold a trade waste agreement will be required to monitor their waste discharge and give us the results to show they comply. Your trade waste agreement sets out the details of self-monitoring. Learn more: \nMonitoring trade waste\nNot sure if you’re producing trade waste?\nTo discuss your trade or business processes and risk level, contact us on (09) 539 7655 or email \n[email protected]\n. \nLow risk trade waste\nWe consider low risk discharges to be a negligible risk. You must follow the conditions in the \nTrade Waste Bylaw 2013\n, but you do not need a trade waste agreement.\nWhat is low risk trade waste?\nIt is any trade waste discharged which:\nis a result of an activity listed in Schedule 1 of the bylaw, meets the requirements listed in schedule 1 and meets the Trade Waste Controls 2019, and\ndoes not have any of the prohibited characteristics listed in Schedule 3 of the bylaw, and\nis less than 10 cubic metres per day and less than 0.5 litres per second.\nYour responsibilities\nYou must meet the pre-treatment requirements listed in Schedule 1 of the bylaw, and treat your waste to \nour standards for controlled substances\n.\nIf the pre-treatment system is not able to meet those standards, you will be required to hold a trade waste agreement, and you must not discharge it without one.\nAll other trade waste\nTrade waste discharges from activities not listed in Schedule 1 of the bylaw are generally considered to be a higher risk. Typically, higher-risk customers will have robust systems to manage their trade waste and will undertake more frequent monitoring.\nWhat is conditional trade waste?\nIt is any trade waste discharged:\nas a result of an activity not listed in Schedule 1 of the Auckland Council Trade Waste Bylaw 2013 and which complies with the Trade Waste Control 2019, unless authorised in a trade waste agreement\nor\nfrom trade premises (including activities listed in Schedule 1 [page 16] of the bylaw) where the discharge exceeds 10 cubic metres per day or exceeds 0.5 litres per second\nor\nwhich we determine to be conditional under Clause 7 (page 7) of the bylaw.\nYour responsibilities\nYou must:\nfollow the regulations set out in the bylaw\nhave a trade waste agreement setting out your discharge limits and monitoring criteria. Learn more and apply for an agreement\ncomply with the Trade Waste Control 2019 unless the agreement authorises an exemption.\nWho needs a trade waste agreement?\nEvery customer who discharges trade waste that is not classified as low risk must hold a current trade waste agreement. See \nWhat is your classification?\nWhat is a management plan?\nTo gain a trade waste agreement, you need to submit a management plan.\nFor full details, see \nSection 3 of the application form.\n \nYour plan should reflect the activities on your site. You can provide sections of other plans (environmental, spill response, etc.).\nYour plan will identify:\npotential risks to our wastewater system created by your site activities\nhow you will reduce these risks.\nHere are two examples:\nManagement plan for a large complex activity (PDF 275KB)\nManagement plan for a smaller simple activity (PDF 182KB).\nWhat happens when the agreement expires?\nEach agreement has a fixed term. When your agreement expires you must renew it.\nTo renew, please submit an updated application: you will need to tick ‘renew application’ in Section 1.\nDownload the application form\nWhat happens if I don’t comply?\nIf we find that a customer is not complying, we will ask them to identify:\nwhat caused the non-compliance\nwhat they did to fix it\nwhat steps they have taken to ensure it does not happen again. \nWe may also do further audit monitoring to verify compliance.\nWhat does Watercare’s monitoring cost?\nView charges for processing, monitoring and site visits.\nFor the cost of sampling and analysis, please contact us on (09) 539 7655 or email \n[email protected]\n. \nWhich documents do I need to refer to?\nThe \nAuckland Trade Waste Bylaw 2013\n and the \nTrade Waste Control 2019\n.\nWhat if the substance or activity I am looking for is not on the list of controlled substance?\nPlease contact us on (09) 539 7655 or at \n[email protected]\n.\nMy trade waste discharges have changed and the details in the agreement do not match them. What should I do?\nContact us on (09) 539 7655 or email \n[email protected]\n immediately to advise us of the changes.\nWhat can I do with waste that cannot be discharged to the sewer?\nA qualified contractor must remove the waste and take it to an industrial treatment plant.\nWhy are there discharge limits?\nBecause controlled substances present specific risks, the discharge limits (listed in the Trade Waste Control 2019) protect the wastewater system, processes, people and the environment.\nCan I apply for a change to the discharge limit for a substance?\nIt may be possible to change some of the limits in the agreement. Please contact us on (09) 539 7655 or email \n[email protected]\n.\nMy agreement does not list all the controlled substance limits\nWhen a controlled substance is not listed in your agreement, the standard limits in the Trade Waste Control 2019 apply.\nWhy does my agreement have a discharge limit for mass?\nSome substances such as heavy metals pass through wastewater treatment processes and build up in the solid waste stream. A large volume of trade waste containing a low concentration of a metal can equate to a significant amount of that metal being discharged over time. This is controlled by mass limits that take into account the volume of the discharge and control the total amount of a substance that is discharged.\nHow do I calculate the mass of a substance in a trade waste discharge, to ensure I comply with the mass limit in the agreement?\nYou determine the mass of a substance by multiplying the concentration of the substance in the discharge by the volume of the discharge over 24 hours.\nFor example:\n150 grams per cubic metre of oil and grease x 100 cubic metres discharged over 24 hours = 15,000 grams or 15 kilograms\nWhy is it important to discharge within the pH range of 6 to 10.5?\nLow pH can be corrosive to the wastewater system, generate odours which can cause a public nuisance, or release toxic hydrogen sulphide gas which can endanger workers.\nHigh pH can be caustic to workers, or generate toxic gases or blockages when it is mixed with other discharges.\nWhere can I get my trade waste discharge tested?\nThe\n IANZ website\n has a list of accredited laboratories for discharge testing. Search for a testing inspection facility under Laboratory - Chemical Testing/2.41 Waters (d) Effluents and trade wastes.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the correct tests are performed and the laboratory is accredited for that test.\nWhat happens if I am not complying?\nYou must investigate, explain the cause, and take steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. We will also undertake compliance audit monitoring. This involves further visits and laboratory testing, and we pass the costs on to the customer.\nWhat if I have a dispute?\nWe aim to provide the highest standard of service at all times. However, if you are dissatisfied with a trade waste matter, you can \ncontact us to make a complaint\n, or phone (09) 442 2222."

This only applies to gravity pipes – pipes that slope downwards, where gravity drives the flow.  \nIf the public wastewater pipe is \ninside the boundary\n, the point of supply is the joint connecting your pipe to our wastewater pipe or manhole. Everything upstream of this is our responsibility. \n\nHere are three examples of our pipes \ninside the property boundary\n:  \nSingle house\nTwo houses/cross-lease\nThree houses/subdivision\nIf the public wastewater pipe is outside the boundary, the point of supply is where your pipe exits the boundary.

    "content": "Coarse mulch \nCoarse mulch, like pine bark, pebbles, recycled concrete and bricks, make a long-lasting mulch that’s excellent for preventing weeds. It’s also very good for keeping the soil cool, particularly if it’s lightly coloured. This mulch won’t improve the soil much and will take nitrogen out of the soil in the short term. To help, spread some nitrogen rich fertiliser on the soil before spreading the mulch. This sort of mulch can be 50 to 75mm deep. \nMedium mulch\nMedium mulch, like pine bark or wood chips, is excellent for reducing weeds. This sort of mulch is usually laid 25 to 50mm deep. One danger with mulch is watering too often, bringing roots to the surface of the soil under the mulch. If the mulch goes or the surface of the soil dries out, when the roots are too shallow, the plants die. The solution is less frequent watering. \nFine mulch \nFine mulch, like sawdust and euca, can stop water getting into the soil, so don’t make it too thick – about 25mm deep – and top it up each year when the ground is starting to dry out. Pea straw, cow and horse manure, and compost make excellent mulches because they improve the soil and attract worms."

    "content": "Don’t leave taps running while using the sink \nWe often leave the tap running when we’re preparing food, peeling vegetables, thawing meat or washing dishes. But, left running, the average tap uses 12 litres of water a minute! Instead, simply fill your sink with the water you need and use it for multiple kitchen duties.  \nStop rinsing dishes before placing in the dishwasher \nIf your dishwasher is reasonably modern, it should be able to clean your dishes with no pre-rinsing. If your dishes aren’t clean after going through the cycle, you may need to clean your filters or repair your dishwasher. If you’re handwashing dishes, fill the sink rather than washing them under a running tap.  \nReduce water flow in the kitchen tap with a tap aerator  \nA swivel tap aerator has two flow settings which let you direct the water to where it’s needed. A tap aerator will reduce water use without sacrificing the tap’s water pressure. Tap aerators are an inexpensive way to save water in the kitchen. You’ll find them in hardware and plumbing stores.  \nUpgrade to an energy-efficient dishwasher \nWhen the time comes to upgrade your current dishwasher, look for one that’s water efficient. You can tell how efficient it is by the water rating. Modern dishwashers use up to 60 per cent less water than older models. Dishwashers with five-star water ratings use as little as 7 litres of water per wash. \nBe a water-wise cook\n For example, use a bowl to scrub vegetables in the kitchen sink. You can then pour the water on your plants. Also, rather than running tap water over frozen food to thaw, let it defrost in the fridge for a few hours. If you’re in a hurry, the microwave is a more efficient option than running water. You can also choose healthy ways of cooking that use less water. Steaming or using a pressure cooker keeps more nutrients in food and saves energy and water. \nKeep a jug of drinking water in the fridge\nRunning your kitchen tap while waiting for the water to be cold wastes many litres of water. Instead, keep water in a covered jug in the fridge. That saves running the tap to get cold water (and gives you delicious, ice-cold drinking water). \nDitch the InSinkErator and try composting\nBuilt-in waste disposal units increase your water use. Why not compost your food waste instead? \nThe Kaipātiki Project\n provides free composting courses throughout Auckland, funded by Auckland Council. The council also offers a discount on composting systems.  \nReduce your shower time \nShowers are the greatest water users in the bathroom. In fact, it’s responsible for 27 per cent of water use in the home overall. So, reducing water use in the shower will have the most significant impact on total bathroom water savings.  \nUse a low-flow showerhead \nMany older showerheads use a lot more water than is needed. Replacing your showerhead with a modern, efficient water-flow rate will save water without compromising performance. Modern heads don’t drop water pressure, but instead pull air into the water stream to give the same full pressure feeling while using a lot less water.  \nTurn off your bathroom tap while brushing teeth or shaving \nLeaving the bathroom tap running while shaving or brushing your teeth uses over five litres of water every time. By simply turning the tap off we can reduce this water use to just one litre. \nDoes your toilet leak? \nThe toilet may not seem an obvious place to save water, but a leaking toilet can waste about 80 litres of water per day. That’s like flushing your toilet seven times a day! \nThere are two ways to check for a leak:\nIf you can't access your cistern, \ndo this simple toilet paper test to see if your toilet is leaking\nIf you can access the cistern, put a few drops of food colouring in it. If colouring ends up in the toilet bowl without flushing, you have a leak.\nIf you get the leak repaired, you’ll notice significant water reduction in the bathroom.\nGet a water-efficient, dual-flush toilet \nIf your toilet needs replacing, consider buying one with a dual flush. Check its water rating label. The latest four-star toilets use as little as three litres for a half flush and 4.5 litres for a full flush. Most toilets in Auckland use around seven litres per flush and older toilets use around 12 litres per flush.  \nYou can still conserve water with a single-flush toilet \nIf your current toilet is a single-flush, you can still save water by installing a gizmo. A gizmo is a simple, inexpensive weight that hangs inside the cistern tube and stops the toilet flushing when you take your finger off the button, meaning you can control how long each flush lasts.  \n \nSwitch from a top-loader washing machine to a front-loader \nFront-loading washing machines typically use about 50 per cent less water, 35 per cent less detergent and 30 per cent less energy than equivalent-sized top-loading washing machines, making them the most cost-effective and water-efficient option. You can find this out by checking the water rating label. If you have a top-loader, our best tip is to be economical in how you wash your clothes. \n \nChange to water-efficient settings on your washing machine \nAnother easy water-saving tip for the laundry is to use the economy settings on your washing machine. Reducing the wash to one rinse cycle rather than two will also save up to 100 litres of water per wash. That adds up if you calculate how many washes you do each year. \nWash full loads \nWashing a full load of laundry is the most water-efficient way to wash your clothes. If you don't have many items of clothing to wash, we recommend you wait until you have a full load ready. If you get caught out and absolutely must do a small load, make sure your washing machine settings are set for low water use. Remember: your machine will rarely default to an economy setting when switched on. You must do this manually.  \n \nUse a bucket and recycle water when washing clothes by hand \nWhen handwashing clothes, use a bucket instead of leaving the tap running. You can reuse this water on your garden straight after (avoid the vegetable patch, as this water may contain microbes). Using a biodegradable detergent with low phosphorus, sodium, and nitrogen will be better for your garden. \nDon’t over-wash your clothes \nJust because an item has been worn, doesn’t mean it requires washing. If your clothing shows no visible stains and passes the ‘smell test’ (used by mothers around the globe), place it back in your drawer for another use. This will not only save water in the laundry but also extend the life of your clothing and keep colours vibrant."

    "content": "Which areas does Watercare supply?\nMost homes and businesses are connected to the metropolitan network, which extends south to Pukekohe and north to Waiwera.\nOverall, about 98 per cent of the water we treat feeds into this network.\nAre there other sources of water?\nSome of our rural communities have a local source. For example, people living in Waiuku receive water that is sourced from an aquifer. It is treated and distributed via the town’s local network.\nWhat is the average rainfall per year in the Auckland region?\nThe Auckland region receives between 1200 and 1250 millimetres of rain per year.\nHow we treat your water\nOur processes start right at the source.\nAuckland’s water comes from varied sources, including dams, bores, springs and rivers. Each treatment plant is designed to deal with its particular sources of raw water.\nThe water from dams in the Hūnua and Waitākere ranges comes from protected areas that are mostly native bush. It requires a relatively low level of treatment to meet the water standards. \nGroundwater typically requires even less treatment, as the raw water is usually free from bacteria and has very low turbidity (cloudiness).\nWater from the Waikato River travels through a number of different environments on its journey to the water treatment plant at Tuakau, so it goes through additional treatment processes. \nTreating water from dams\nFour plants treat Auckland’s dam water.\nMost of Auckland's water comes from dams in the Hūnua and Waitākere ranges. It is treated at four plants: Ardmore, Huia, Huia Village and Waitākere.\n1. Screening\nWater passes through screens that remove any large debris, such as leaves, branches, rubbish and dead insects.\n2. Coagulation\nTo remove any dirt that remains, we typically add a compound known as aluminium sulphate (alum) to the water. The alum and dirt particles stick together (coagulate) into large, heavier particles called ‘flocs’.\n3. Clarification\nThe water is pumped into settling tanks, or clarifiers, where most of the floc settles on the bottom of the tank and is removed. The clarified water is collected from the top of the tank.\n4. Filtration\nThe water is forced through sand filters. These trap any remaining particles in the water.\n5. Chlorine disinfection\nChlorine is added to kill any germs (micro-organisms), such as E. coli and campylobacter, which might remain after filtration.\n6. Fluoride\nFluoride is added to the Auckland metropolitan water supply, with the exception of Onehunga. This is at the request of Auckland’s legacy councils (before Auckland Council integration).\n27 July 2022 - Auckland Council directed to fluoridate Onehunga, Waiuku water supplies\nWe have been directed by the Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield to install fluoride dosing systems at our Onehunga Water Treatment Plant by 30 June 2024. By 30 June 2026, we are required to upgrade our three Waiuku plants and fluoridate the community’s water supply. To read more about this decision, click here.\n7. pH balancing\nThe final stage is to balance the pH of the water.\nTreating water from the Waikato River\nTo maintain quality we take extra steps. This is because the water travels more than 400 kilometres through towns, past farms and industries before it reaches our treatment plant in Tuakau.  Runoff from farms and industries that use the water, such as power stations, affects the quality of the water before we treat it.\nOur ultra-filtration process uses membrane technology: clarified water passes through fine membrane filters that prevent tiny micro-organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium from passing though. This makes the Waikato treatment plant one of the most sophisticated in Australasia.\nWhat is drinking water?\nDrinking water is the term we use for the water we supply through your taps. In the Auckland region it is safe for drinking and cooking, and for all the other uses around the home – cleaning the dishes, taking showers, washing the laundry, flushing the toilet, watering the garden.\nWhat's in my water?\nFluoride\nFluoride is a natural element found in air, soil, fresh water, seawater, plants and lots of foods. Adding fluoride to public water supplies is a proven health measure to reduce tooth decay and strengthen teeth.\nWe add fluoride to the water supply at the request of the Director General of Health, under the Health (Fluoridation of Drinking Water) Amendment Act 2021. Our current role is to undertake and maintain compliant fluoridation system operations.\nThe amount of fluoride the Ministry of Health recommends is between 0.7 and 1.0 parts per million in drinking water.\nLearn more: \nMinistry of Health\n27 July 2022 - Auckland Council directed to fluoridate Onehunga, Waiuku water supplies\nWe have been directed by the Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield to install fluoride dosing systems at our Onehunga Water Treatment Plant by 30 June 2024. By 30 June 2026, we are required to upgrade our three Waiuku plants and fluoridate the community’s water supply. \nChlorine\nDuring the treatment process, chlorine is added to kill any harmful bacteria. Chlorine evaporates quickly and has been used effectively around the world for over 100 years.\nLime\nLime is added to protect the water supply pipes from corrosion.\nWhy is Auckland's water considered soft?\nWater in New Zealand is comparatively soft. It is generally low in the minerals and salts that make water hard.\nThis is also true of water in the Auckland region. Our metropolitan treatment plants draw water mainly from surface water sources. These are low in calcium and salts compared to groundwater, which picks up minerals as it makes its way into waterways.\nHard water is difficult to lather with soap or shampoo, it builds up scale deposits on water-using appliances, and leaves residue on bathtubs and showers.\nI want to report a water quality issue\nIf you have any concerns about the quality of water we supply, such as a change in clarity, taste or smell, please phone (09) 442 2222, press 1.\nWe will investigate and if necessary test it to find the cause.\nWhy should I flush my tap?\nMost of the water supplied in New Zealand is slightly acidic. Acidic water is also known as plumbosolvent water – this means it dissolves lead and other heavy metals.\nThe Ministry of Health believes that the risk from heavy metals in drinking water is small. However, as a precaution, it recommends that all households flush a large glass (500ml) of water from their drinking water tap each morning to eliminate the risk. You may want to collect this water and reuse it to water your pot plants.\nWhat is plumbosolvency?\nPlumbosolvency is the ability of a solvent (usually a liquid) to dissolve other substances.\nPlumbosolvent water can dissolve any metals that it comes into contact with. If it is left sitting for several hours in your household plumbing fittings, small amounts of heavy metals from these fittings can enter the water supply. \nHeavy metals commonly dissolved in drinking water include lead, nickel, cadmium and copper.\nIs plumbosolvency a problem with the water supply?\nNo. This is not about the chemical quality of your drinking water but about whether the water has had prolonged contact with metals in household plumbing fittings.\nWe continue to meet the requirements of the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand 2005 (revised 2008) and deliver safe water that you can use from your taps each day. \nUnder the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand 2005 (revised 2008), the Ministry of Health requires water suppliers to alert residents to the issue of plumbosolvency. For water suppliers serving more than 1000 people, such as Watercare, this is done twice a year through a public notice from the Ministry of Health.\nWater supplies are considered to be plumbosolvent until the water supplier can show otherwise.\nRead our water quality reports\nAre there any health risks from the drinking water?\nHeavy metals are a health concern whether they come from drinking water, air or food. They can build up in the organs of your body. High levels can be harmful to your health.\nInfants, children and pregnant women are more susceptible to the toxic effects of heavy metals, so steps should be taken to reduce heavy metal concentrations in water that this group of people may consume.\nLead is the main heavy metal in drinking water and the one that poses the greatest health concern. Lead cannot be removed from the body, so it builds up in the skeleton and can damage nerves and organs. Infants, children and pregnant women are most susceptible to lead's toxic effects, which can include brain and kidney damage.\nDoes it matter if I am on public or private water supplies?\nNo. Flushing your drinking water taps is recommended for all households, whether on public or private water supplies.\nHow do our dams compare in size?\nMangatangi is our largest dam. Completed in 1977, it has a lake area of 185 hectares and capacity of 35.3 gigalitres. Upper Mangatawhiri is our second largest dam. It has a lake area of 128.5 hectares and capacity of 16.2 gigalitres.\nIn terms of capacity, Upper Nihotupu Dam holds 2.2 gigalitres and spills into Lower Nihotupu Dam. Waitākere Dam holds 1.76 gigalitres and doesn't spill into another dam, so when it's full we maximise its production.\nHow much does Hays Creek Dam store?\nHays Creek Dam is tiny compared to our biggest dams Mangatangi and Upper Mangatawhiri. It spans 18.2 hectares and has a capacity of only 1.1 gigalitres. Interestingly, unlike our other catchment areas, it is not a protected catchment. This dam was taken out of service several years ago as it was supplying only a fraction of Auckland's drinking water and was expensive to run. It was reconnected to the metropolitan supply in February 2021, boosting Auckland’s capacity by six million litres a day and by up to 12 million litres a day by August 2023.\nHow much water do the Hūnua dams provide?\nOur dams in the Hūnua Ranges are by far the largest. Combined they cover 534 hectares and normally provide 60 per cent of Auckland’s water.\nHow much water do the Waitākere dams provide?\nOur dams in the Waitākere Ranges cover 162 hectares and normally provide 20 per cent of Auckand's water supply.\nWhy can’t you strategically keep your dams low and prevent them from spilling?\nAuckland’s water supply dams aren’t designed for the rapid drawdown of their water levels and are not suitable for flood management purposes. If they did have the infrastructure to do this, we would lose a significant amount of the city’s water storage capacity and reduce the water available during a drought, which would bring forward the need to invest in new water sources.\nWhy is Waitākere Dam typically one of the first to spill?\nWaitākere Dam is the highest elevated dam, and like Hays Creek Dam it is tiny compared to our biggest dams which are located in the Hūnua Ranges. It spans 25.1 hectares, has a capacity of 1.76 gigalitres and is the smallest dam in the Waitākere Ranges. In 2020, it reached 100 per cent capacity and was spilling. Its size along with the fact it has received more rainfall than other catchment areas are key factors in causing it to spill. When full, in order to reduce the amount of spillage our team maximises production from Waitākere Dam.\nHow can I confirm that I have a leak?\nIf you have an unexpectedly high water bill, it may be due to a leak. To learn more, see:\nHigher bill than usual\nHow to check for a leak\nWho pays to repair a leak?\nIt is the property owner's responsibility to fix leaks and pay for any repairs.\nIf you don’t have funds readily available to pay for leak repairs, you may seek help from \nWork and Income\n,\n phone 0800 559 009.\nHow soon should I apply for the allowance?\nOnce you've been made aware of the leak, you must send the form to us \nwithin three months.\nWhat does the allowance cover?\nThe allowance will be for excess water use compared to your average use calculated from your previous two meter reads.\nIf you have not been at the property for a full year, the typical average daily use will be applied.\nWhen will the allowance take effect?\nWe will process requests within 10 working days of receiving your application, or earlier if possible.\nIf we accept your application, you'll receive a letter stating the allowance amount, how much you have left to pay on your bill and your new due date.\nThe allowance will appear as a credit in the current charges section on your next bill.\nI've fixed a leak. Why is my latest bill still high?\nThe most likely reason is that we alternate actual and estimated meter readings.\nThe chart below shows an example of this scenario. The first high bill due to a leak is in May. The leak is fixed sometime in June or July, but there is a second high bill in July. \nThe estimate in June is significantly lower as it is based on the last two normal actual reads (January and March).\nThe July bill is still higher than usual because it has recorded the rest of the leak between receiving the May bill and when it was fixed (sometime between the June and July bills).\nView an example of this on a bill\n.\nIf you think this situation applies to you, please contact us so we can consider a further allowance. Phone: (09) 442 2222, press 2.\nCan I get a refund if my account goes into credit due to a leak allowance?\nIf you want a refund, please complete and send the \nform to request a refund\n.\nIn some situations, such as when a tenant is seeking a refund, we may ask you to provide receipts as proof of who made the initial payments to us.\nI am a commercial customer. Can I apply for the allowance?\nYes, but the allowance will be for wastewater charges only.\nCan I get an allowance for another leak?\nIf you have another leak within two years of receiving the allowance, you may send a new application. You must attach a plumber’s invoice.\nNote: the allowance for a second leak will only be for excess wastewater charges.\nDo I have to pay Watercare if I use a rain tank for my water?\nIf you are connected to the public wastewater network we will charge you for this service.\nTypes of meters\n.\nHow do I read my meter?\nFollow the steps in this guide: \nFind and read my water meter.\nI want to add another meter/move my meter\nMoving or installing a meter is done at your cost.    \nTo apply to move your meter see \nChange a connection\nTo apply for an additional meter, see \nApply for a residential connection\nWhere is my meter?\nThe water meter is usually in the ground at the front of the property, near the left or right boundary.\nFind and read my water meter\n.\nWho repairs my meter?\nWe own and are responsible for all Watercare meters.\nWhat if the meter reader can't access my meter?\nAs the property owner, you must make sure we can enter your property to read the meter. If we can’t gain access, for example because of a locked gate or overgrown garden, we will have to make an estimate of your water usage. \nIf there is a problem with access to your property, please view \nthis form\n. \nHow do I arrange for a meter reading?\nEmail your request to us:\nRequest a special meter reading\nRequest a final meter reading\nWhat is my water meter number?\nThe meter number is on the reverse side of your bill, under ‘Consumption details’. If you are registered with \nMyAccount\n you can view the bill online. For help, go to MyAccount help and follow the steps for View/download/print a bill.\nYou can also find the number on your meter. \nFind and read my water meter\n.\nWhich water meter serves my property?\nIf you are not sure which is your water meter, you can do a simple test using your water bill and the kitchen tap. \nDownload the water meter guide\n.\nWho maintains the meter?\nWe own and are responsible for all Watercare meters (including shared meters and subsidiary meters). \nWho is responsible?\nCheck meters are privately owned and are the responsibility of the owner. \nLearn more about check meters.\nCan I add/move/disconnect a meter?\nResidential meters: For the application form and a checklist of the information we require, go to \nApply for a residential connection\n.\nBusiness meters: For the application form and a checklist of the information we require, go to \nApply for a business connection\n.\nWhat is a smart meter?\nA smart meter is a water meter that measures consumption electronically. Water usage readings are taken every thirty minutes and this data is sent to us once daily. You can get the readings directly to your phone via our app to help manage your water use and receive notification about possible leaks. It records battery level, signal strength, date and time, and sends alerts if there is a problem with the meter. \nWhat are the benefits of a smart meter?\nMonthly bills from us based on your actual water use. With mechanical meters, your bill is based on an estimate every second month. \nLive visibility of your water usage through our app. See your monthly, daily and half hourly use, to help conserve water and keep your costs down. \nQuick notification about possible water leaks through our app, so you can save water and avoid a higher bill. \nWill every property's water meter be replaced?\nAll eligible water meters will be replaced with smart meters over time. We are prioritising the meters that are 10-15 years old. Water meters are owned by us not the property owner, and we replace them due to wear and tear. Eligibility includes meter size, age and signal strength.\nCan I pay for a smart meter and get one sooner? \nNo. The replacement process cannot be fast tracked by offering to pay for the installation. \nHow will I know if my meter is going to be replaced?\nWe will notify the people living at your property a few weeks ahead of replacing the meter.\nWhat impact will the replacement have on me?\nWe will need to turn off your water supply for around one hour during the installation.\nHow is the installation done?\nOn the day of the installation, our contractors will knock on your door to let you know they are replacing the meter and need to turn off the water for around one hour. They will have ID cards with them and will be wearing high visibility clothing. Once they have replaced the meter, they will turn the water back on and leave a note in your mailbox.\nHow does the smart meter work?\nThe smart device and the water meter are fully integrated in one unit. The meter takes readings every 30 minutes and this data is sent to us once daily. The device also records battery level, signal strength, date and time, and sends alerts if there is a problem with the meter or your water supply.\nHow often will the smart meter transmit my data?\nThe smart meter will transmit data once a day to our secure information database.\nWill I be able to receive my water usage data?\nOne of the benefits of downloading our smart meter app is being able to track water use and receive water-saving tips. See \nUse our app\n.\nWill the battery in the smart meter need checking and/or replacing regularly?\nNo. The battery is fully enclosed within the unit to protect it from water. It is expected to last 10-15 years.\nWill I be able to read my water meter after the smart device is installed?\nYes, you will still be able to read your meter.\nIf I have a leak, will the meter show constant movement?\nYes. The droplet symbol will appear if water is being used. If there is no water being used and the water droplet symbol is showing, this indicates a leak.\nWhat do I do if my meter is in flight mode?\nThis needs to be resolved by our faults team as it indicates that the installation process is incomplete. Faults will need to find out who carried out the installation and request that they return to the property to activate the meter.\nHow long will a smart meter last?\nAs with the mechanical meters, the smart meters are expected to last 10-15 years. Over this period, its readings will remain accurate. Its lifespan is based on its battery which is fully enclosed within the unit.\nHow should I care for my meter?\nAs a customer, it is your responsibility to ensure the meter doesn’t become overgrown (with grass, shrubs and leaves) so our team can access it for maintenance.  It is also important that you have easy access to turn off your water supply should you have a sudden leak and require a plumber.\nWill the new device affect my bill?\nThere is no additional cost for the new meter reading device.\nYou will start to receive monthly bills based on your actual water use. Your first bill after the meter replacement will show usage from the old meter and the new meter.  Your account number will remain the same. See billing example below.\nSmart meters accurately record the volume of water entering a property, ensuring the monthly bill reflects a household's water use. As mechanical meters age, they can under record a household's water use which means, when people switch to a smart meter they may notice their bills increase a little.\nCan I choose the day I get billed?\nNo.\nIs my smart meter being billed automatically?\nYes, from 30 November 2022 customers will be billed off smart meter data.\nWill I continue to receive estimate reads?\nYour bill will be generated directly from your smart meter data rather than from a manual read. If your meter stops sending data and we are unable to obtain an actual reading you will receive an estimate.\nHow is the water bill calculated?\nEach property receives a bill for their own use through their sub meter. We then add up the usage from all the sub meters and compare this to the master meter usage. The master is the first in line so will capture all usage going through the private network.\nIf there is a difference in usage then each dwelling that is connected via the master will receive an equal share of the usage.\nExample:\nNetwork of master meter and three sub meters (kL = kilolitre):\nUsage for network is master 36 kL, sub 1 = 15 kL, sub 2 = 8 kL, sub 3 = 10 kL\nTotal usage for all sub meters = 33 kL\nCalculation:\nSub 1 = 15 + ((36-33)/3) = 16 kL\nSub 2 = 8 + ((36-33)/3) = 9 kL\nSub 3 = 10 + ((36-33)/3) = 11 kL\nTotal network usage\n = 36 kL (16 + 9 + 11)\nWho is responsible for maintenance and repairs of master and sub meters?\nWe are responsible for the pipe between the public watermain in the road, and the master meter. \nThe property owners are jointly responsible for the water pipe between the master and sub meter. Each owner is responsible for the pipe between the sub meter and their dwelling.\nSee \nWho is responsible for pipes?\nI have a check meter. Will this change my water bill?\nNo. Installing a check meter does not change the way we charge our customers.\nWho owns and maintains check meters?\nCheck meters are privately owned. Watercare does not own, install or maintain them. We don’t read these meters even if we are asked to.\nThe property owner buys their own check meter and pays a plumber to install it.\nThe owner is responsible for reading, maintaining and repairing the meter and the water pipe, at their own cost.\nCommercial check meters\nEven if check meters are installed, we would still maintain the commercial classification of the main meter, if one or more commercial businesses are connected to it.\nWho tests the meter?\nThe property owner is responsible for testing the meter each year. This ensures it is calibrated correctly to record the actual amount of water you are using.\nWhy use an irrigation meter?\nFor watering large areas, an irrigation meter may be more cost-effective than using water coming from the meter already at your property.\nThe water measured by an irrigation meter does not drain into the wastewater network, so there are no wastewater charges for this meter.\nHow do I apply for an irrigation meter?\nFor information and to download the application form, go to \nApply for an irrigation meter.\nWhat does it cost to install an irrigation meter?\nApply and install\nThere is an application processing fee and installation fee. \nView fees\nOther costs\nThese may apply, depending on extra labour and expenses due to site constraints, such as hard surfaces, special paving, road crossings, extending the watermain.\nPlumber or drainlayer\nWhen the meter is installed, it must be connected to your hoses or irrigation system. This part of the water network is private, so you will need to ask a plumber about the charges.\nWhat does it cost to use and maintain an irrigation meter?\nThe meter will measure your water use, and your monthly bill will be based on volumetric usage. See \nOur charges\n. \nA backflow prevention device testing fee applies each year. \nWhat are the alternatives to an irrigation meter?\nBecause of the costs, you need to carefully consider the potential savings before deciding to install an irrigation meter.\nYou may want to use a rainwater tank for small outdoor areas, as this is comparatively easier and cheaper to set up.\nYou can also look at \nsaving water in your house\n and \ngarden\n.\nWhy does the meter have a backflow prevention device?\nThe backflow prevention device stops contaminants (such as pesticides, herbicides or fungicides sometimes added to irrigation sprayers) entering the drinking water supply. See \nBackflow\n.\nWill my wastewater charges change with an irrigation meter?\nSince July 2022, we will not increase your wastewater charge on your main meter when you install a secondary supply, such as an irrigation meter. The wastewater charge for your main meter will remain at 78.5% for a standard residential property or 95% for an apartment. \nHow commercial charges work.\nWhy install a water meter?\nA water meter could save you money on your water bill.  \nThe meter measures how much water flows into your household. If you use less water, you will also be discharging less wastewater.\nReading your meter enables us to calculate how much wastewater you produce. If you discharge less wastewater in any month, we will charge less for the volumetric part of your bill.\nIf you use less than 220kL per year, it may be more economical to have a meter (excluding the cost of installing and maintaining the meter).\nOur trial of rain tank water meters in 2013 found that:\nhouseholds of 1-3 people who are careful with their water use could save around $10 to $25 a month.\nhouseholds of 4 or more people who are very low water users may also benefit.\nWhat will it cost to install a meter?\nThe cost will vary according to where your pump is, and whether you need to upgrade your private plumbing before we can install the meter. Check with suppliers for the price of the meter itself.\nBefore you go ahead, you should get an estimate for any work from a certified plumber.\nWe charge a $50 application fee, which we add to your first volumetric wastewater bill.\nCan I switch to a combined fixed/volumetric charge for a rain water tank meter?\nYes, you can change to the combined billing method if:\nyour household or business is connected to the public wastewater network, and\nyour primary water supply is a rain tank or bore.\nYou need to assess whether changing to combined billing is best for your situation. Currently, most water tank owners pay the fixed charge only.\nTo switch to combined billing:\nStep 1: \nRead our terms and condition for rain tank water metering\n. \nStep 2: Before you decide, get a quote from a plumber for installing your meter.\nStep 3: When the meter is installed, complete the \nrain tank water meter application form\n and send it to us.\nStep 4: After we approve your application, we will switch your charges from the fixed charge only to the combined fixed/volumetric charge.\nYour new wastewater charge \nYour new wastewater charge will have two parts:\na fixed charge\na volumetric charge, based on the amount of water flowing through your water meter.\nView this year’s charges:\nResidential charges\nBusiness charges\nWhat is purified recycled water?\nWhat is purified recycled water?\nPurified recycled water is water that would otherwise not be used, which has been treated to drinking water quality. \nWater reuse is a growing trend worldwide. Here in Auckland, a citizens’ assembly tasked with recommending the next source of water for the city determined that direct purified recycled water would be the best solution to meet our water needs beyond 2040. This means supplying highly treated recycled water directly from an advanced water treatment plant into the distribution system. \nThe assembly chose this source because of its lower cost and better environmental outcomes (relative to the other options). It is not a new concept on a world scale – having originated in the 1960s – but it will be a new initiative for our customers. Regardless of the source, all drinking water must pass the same strict health and safety controls before water is provided to our communities and customers.\nIndirect purified recycled water uses an environmental buffer, such as a river, dam, or groundwater aquifer to store highly treated recycled water. The water is then abstracted and treated at a drinking water treatment plant before it enters the drinking water distribution system. \nAuckland’s water strategy has targets for recycled water which include producing 100 million litres per day of non-dam (rainwater and recycled water) by 2050.\nWhat are the benefits of purified recycled water?\nLocal control of our water sources\nIt can be lower cost and more energy efficient that other water source options\nIt reduces the water taken from the environment\nIt reduces the flows of fresh (not salty) water into our harbours\nIt reduces nutrient discharges to waterways\nIt is a climate resilient (non-rain dependent) supply\nQuality and safety\nIn 2022, a panel of experts gave advice to our citizens’ assembly members and answered their burning questions. That information along with videos of the expert interviews are available for you to access (see below). Some of the key questions and answers to come out of the expert sessions were:\nWhat minerals will be in our drinking water as a result of wastewater recycling processes? Do the treatment processes remove beneficial as well as harmful minerals?\nWater recycling removes everything from water even though it may have been beneficial (e.g. some minerals such as iodine). This water needs to be re-mineralised in the treatment process.\nIs there a buffer if something goes wrong?\nPublic health in critical, and the treatment systems are very closely monitored before water enters the piped network. These systems have a range of safeguards and a high ‘margin of safety’, meaning that they are designed to deal with occasional breaches of contaminant levels and keep the water safe for drinking.\nAre there contaminants that can’t be tested for yet?\nThere is a lot of focus in the water treatment industry on new classes and groups of contaminants, and analytical methods are continuously improving to detect them. Biomonitoring provides additional assurance that untested or not yet detected chemicals of concern would not go undetected. When processing water from a wastewater treatment plant, reverse osmosis is commonly used. This highly effective process removes everything out of the water, even dissolved salts and most chemicals and microorganisms. This combined with the multiple barriers will cover these contaminants.\nFor more information, please visit \nhttps://www.complexconversations.nz/ca-materials/ \nHow are we engaging with our customers?\nWe have several initiatives planned to keep the community informed and engaged. These include pilot projects and hosting educational tours of our purified recycled water demonstration plant in Māngere. More initiatives will be underway over the next few years to help the public understand the safety and value of this source of water.\nImportant points from the Water Services Association of Australia\nPurified recycled water is now part of the water supply mix in over 35 cities around the world, especially in America.\nIt is scientifically proven, environmentally sustainable, and all schemes are required to meet strict health and safety standards. It has been used around the world for decades.\nAny water that we take from the environment contains impurities, which the water industry removes through treatment processes. We can take water from different sources and treat it to drinking water quality.\nMany cities that now use purified recycled water as part of their drinking water supply were experiencing drought when their recycled water projects were initiated. But most places don’t use it as a ‘drought-only option’ – it is mostly used as a sustainable long-term option all the time.\nFor more information: \nWater Services Association of Australia key messages: Purified recycled water for drinking\nHow is a town to tank connection different from a standard connection?\nA town to tank connection provides water at a lower flow rate than a standard water meter.\nTown to tank water meter: 2 to 8 litres per minute\nStandard water meter: at least 25 litres per minute\nThis means that with a town to tank connection, it could take around three days to top up a rain tank with 10,000 litres. With a standard connection, the water is plumbed directly into your home, not via your rain tank.\nHow do I connect to a town to tank connection?\nYou will need to engage a registered plumber to complete the installation on \nyour side of the water meter.\n Their work will need to comply with the Building Act as well as the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act. You may choose to run a pipe up to your rain tank or you may choose to install a tap inside your boundary, enabling you to run a hose as required.\nImportantly, we need you to ensure that the hose or pipe used to top-up your tank is not submerged in the rainwater. There needs to be an air gap of at least 25mm between the hose or pipe and the highest overflow level.\nHow do I operate a town to tank connection?\nYou are responsible for installing and operating the plumbing on \nyour side of the water meter\n.\nImportantly, we need you to ensure that the hose or pipe used to top-up your tank is not submerged in the rainwater. There needs to be an air gap of at least 25mm between the hose or pipe and the highest overflow level.\nWe also suggest you:\nBury your private pipe to avoid the sun heating the water.\nFlush water through the pipe before topping up your tank – this is to remove the water that will have been sitting in the pipe since your last top up.\nHow quickly can you connect my property after I apply?\nOnce we receive your application, we will take up to 10 days working days to process it. If approved, we will send you a bill that covers the installation costs as well as the infrastructure growth charge. Once this bill is paid, the low-flow meter will be installed within 12 working days.\nCan my neighbour and I share a connection?\nNo, each property needs to apply for its own connection.\nCan I upgrade later to a standard connection?\nYes, you can upgrade to a standard connection at any time. You will need to pay the difference between the town to tank and standard infrastructure growth charges at the time of upgrading.\nIf I install a tap at my boundary, how can I stop other people from using it?\nThe plumbing on your side of the water meter is your responsibility. Please speak to your plumber about your options. For example, you may be able to padlock the gate valve at your water meter or you may be able to install a lockable hose tap.\nMy house and rain tank are uphill of my property boundary. Is the low-flow connection suitable for me?\nFlow and pressure are different. While the Town to tank water connection provides a low-flow rate, we expect the pressure to be like other properties in the area with standard connections. This means we expect it to be able to push water uphill.\nHowever, pressure can fluctuate. If you install the connection and find it is not working well for you, we can change the size of the restrictor at no additional cost.\nWhat are the connection and ongoing charges for town to tank?\nBelow are the connection and ongoing charges for town to tank and standard connections. This is to help you to compare the two options. In addition to these costs, you will need to engage a plumber to carry out work on \nyour side of the water meter\n.\nNew meter:\n The town to tank connection includes a service lead and backflow device.\nInfrastructure growth charge (IGC): \nThe Town to tank IGC is cheaper because the flow rate is lower than a standard connection. With a Town to tank connection, it could take around three days to top up a tank with 10,000 litres.\nApplication processing fee (per hour, one hour minimum)\nOngoing charges\nAnnual fixed water charge:\n Town to tank connection customers will pay the annual fixed water charge in monthly instalments. \nVolumetric charge per 1,000 litres of water: \nTown to tank connection customers will be billed for their water use every second month based on actual water meter reads. Standard connection customers will be billed every month for their water use based on alternating actual and estimated water meter reads.\nWhat type of water meter and backflow device will be installed?\nOnce your application has been approved and you have paid your bill, we will install the following outside your property:\nA 15mm water meter with a tag identifying it as a low-flow meter\nA testable backflow device\nWhy does a town to tank connection require a backflow prevention device?\nWe must ensure we protect the public network from contamination. The backflow prevention device means water cannot flow from the rain tank into the public network by accident or during a break or network shutdown.\nWhy do I have to pay an infrastructure growth charge for town to tank?\nAnyone who connects to our network must pay an infrastructure growth charge (IGCs). This charge covers the cost of providing new infrastructure to accommodate growth. For example, developing new water sources, treatment plants, pump stations and large pipes. It doesn’t cover the cost of upgrading local infrastructure at a suburban street level. That is paid for by existing customers through their monthly charges. \nFind out more about IGCs\n.\nWhy do I need a wastewater connection in order to apply for a town to tank connection?\nInitially, we are focusing on our existing wastewater customers because helps us to deliver a simple and easy set-up process. Once we have the service up and running smoothly, we will consider offering it other households that are close to our networks and have enough onsite storage.  \nWill my wastewater charges change?\nNo, this connection will not affect your wastewater charges.\nIf you would like to be charged volumetrically for your wastewater services, you will need to install a rain tank water meter. If you have a rain tank water meter, the meter reader will continue to read this meter as well as your new town to tank meter.\nWhat is a water and wastewater servicing strategy?\nA water and wastewater servicing strategy is a long-term plan that helps ensure communities have clean and safe water to use and drink, and that the water used is treated properly before being returned to the environment.\nA servicing strategy considers things like finding water sources, making sure we don't waste water, and building treatment plants to clean water and safely dispose of wastewater. The strategy also thinks about how we can ensure we have enough water for the future, and that our assets are durable and resilient to factors such as climate change.\nServicing strategies will be progressively developed for the 30 catchments across our network. In some cases, multiple catchments will be grouped together for a servicing strategy. A good example is the large metropolitan servicing strategy which will include many catchment areas from the North Shore through to South Auckland.\nOur servicing strategies will:\nBe long-term, looking out at least 70 years\nBe cognisant of mana whenua and local community values and aspirations\nConsider long-term impacts of external factors such as population growth, network demand, climate change, and changing regulatory requirements\nBe flexible and adaptable for future uncertainty, providing resilience for future generations\nProvide options and high-level cost estimates\nInform choices about water sources, discharge points, sea-level rise, resource allocation and priorities\nInform our Asset Management Plan (AMP) for future-focused investment planning and prioritisation.\nWhat does a servicing strategy consider?\nThe diagram below shows some of the many factors that the servicing strategies will consider when planning for future decisions and investment. This includes various aspects of community wellbeing such as environmental, social, cultural, and economic. In the process of decision-making, trade-offs between various factors will be important. Making the right trade-offs and investment choices will help future communities remain healthy but also resilient to future challenges.\nWhy the need for a 70 year servicing strategy?\nInfrastructure servicing strategies are plans that ensure our water systems and physical assets are well-maintained and upgraded over time because they play a critical role in our daily lives. We plan for 70 years because infrastructure is expensive to build and maintain, and we want to make sure it lasts. To do this, we use an approach that breaks down the 70-year timeframe into smaller planning periods called horizons (refer to the below image). This helps decision-makers anticipate future needs, plan infrastructure development accordingly, and avoid costly last-minute investments. Anticipating future infrastructure needs can help build community resilience.\nBy anticipating major changes and being willing to adjust the servicing strategies and plans as conditions change, we can develop large-scale infrastructure projects that are aligned with future needs and prepared for potential challenges\nHow do you work with mana whenua?\nOur relationship with mana whenua is a partnership. It is a collaborative relationship between local iwi or hapū, which recognises mana whenua as kaitiaki or guardians of the land. The partnership ensures that cultural values, knowledge, and aspirations are respected and integrated into our decision-making processes. This partnership involves the sharing of information, resources, and decision-making to address community and environmental issues. Working together, we can achieve better outcomes for the community, enhance cultural understanding, and promote environmental sustainability.\nWe recognise the significance of Mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems) and their valuable contribution towards preserving natural resources with a long-term vision. When we develop the servicing strategies and make decisions, these principles provide us with fresh perspectives and opportunities to achieve outcomes that are agreed to by everyone. Through our joint efforts, we can create positive outcomes for the community and safeguard our natural resources for generations to come. ­­\nWho installs and tests backflow devices?\nBoundary/containment devices \nWatercare installs all backflow devices except for fire supplies. As the property owner, you are responsible for maintaining and annually testing the correct backflow device at your boundary. \nWhen required, we reserve the right to fix or upgrade a faulty device to reduce risks to the water network. We will recover reasonable costs for this work from you.\nInternal devices\nAuckland Council oversees testing of backflow devices within your property.\nWhich water connections require a backflow device?\nResidential customers\nYou need a backflow device if you want to:\nInstall an irrigation meter\nInstall a fire sprinkler\n.\nBusiness customers\nYou need a backflow device if you want to:\nApply for a new or additional water meter\nMove or separate a meter\nInstall a fire sprinkler\nInstall an irrigation meter\nYou DO NOT need a device if you want to:\nDisconnect a meter\nIncrease meter size\nWhat information is required when I apply for a connection?\nWhen you apply to us for a water connection that requires a backflow device, you must include scale plans showing all existing or proposed backflow prevention devices. The plans must be stamped ‘approved’ by Auckland Council for building or resource consent.\nIs my property a backflow risk?\nProperties are classified into three degrees of risk. This determines the type of backflow device you need to install.\nRisk:\n High\nActivity:\n Uses or produces toxic or bacterial matter that may cause death or serious illness if leaked into the main water supply.\nExamples:\n Hospitals, mortuaries, chemical plants, cooling towers, air conditioners, hairdressing salons, commercial laundries.\nDevice:\n Reduced pressure zone.\nTesting:\n Annual\nRisk: \nMedium\nActivity: \nProduces backflow that can endanger health.\nExamples:\n Public swimming pools, garden irrigation systems.\nDevice:\n Double-check valve.\nTesting: \nAnnual\nRisk:\n Low\nActivity:\n Could cause a nuisance from colour, smell or taste but does not endanger health.\nExamples:\n Most private homes.\nDevice: \nAir gap separation or hose vacuum break valve.\nTesting:\n Annual\nIdentifying high and medium-risk properties\nWe conduct regular surveys to find high and medium-risk properties that require backflow devices. If we identify your property, we will send you a letter advising you about surveying your property.

Our contractors can leave the bottled water on your doorstep, in a chosen area, or hand deliver it to you on your doorstep.\nWhy has my application been rejected?\nUpon assessing your application, we may not have been able to determine your vulnerability and may require more information. We will inform you if your application is rejected.\nHow long does the approval process take?\nOur dedicated team aims to have your application processed within 10 working days.\nWho can make changes to my loved one’s account?\nA solicitor acting on behalf of the estate.\nAn executor of the estate (we will need to sight a copy of the will, or receive a letter from the acting solicitor stating you are either the executor or nominated trustee).\nIf the property was owned by more than one person, other listed property owners can make changes.\nWhat do I do If I have a joint account with someone who has passed away?\nLet us know who passed away so we can record it on the account. We’ll need to know: if you will become the sole property owner, if someone will own the property with you, or if the property will be sold (the solicitor acting for the estate can help provide supporting legal documents).\nWhat information do I need to give you to make changes?\nWe need to see a copy of your loved one’s will stating that you are an executor or trustee; or a supporting letter from the solicitor managing the estate to corroborate that you are an executor and authorised to make account changes.\nHow do I transfer the account name to mine?\nYou don’t, this will happen automatically if you are the recipient, or executor of the property. The solicitor handling the estate will provide the relevant legal documents to support this change.\nWhy can’t you change the account name right away?\nWater bills operate differently to other utility sectors. A name change to an account will only take place with the support of a legal transfer document provided by the solicitor.\nCan I change the mailing and payment information?\nWe can change the bill delivery method to the property address. If we need to change the billing method to any other address, we will need proof that you are an executor and authorised to make a change on the account.\nPayment information ie: direct debit can be updated using our \nonline direct debit authority form\n or you can phone us on 09 442 2222.\nNo one is living at the property; can you cancel the account?\nUnlike other utilities we don’t close the account between occupancies. The water account will only close when we are notified of a title transfer or ownership change.\nCan you give me the balance of the account?\nWe can only confirm payment and charge information with an authorised person. We may need to ask you for a copy of the will or supporting legal documents from the estate solicitor before we can give this information to you.\nI used to have Power of Attorney on my loved one’s account. Can I still use this to manage the account?\nPower of Attorney ceases upon death. After your loved one has passed you need to be the nominated executor to be authorised to access the account.\nDo I need to give you a copy of the death certificate?\nNo, we don’t need to see this as we don’t close an account without receiving either a transfer of title or notice of sale agreement from the solicitor.\nMy loved one didn’t leave a will, or we can’t find one – what can I do?\nWe won’t be able to action any changes on the account nor give you any account information (this is in accordance with the privacy act).  Please get in touch so we can classify the account as a deceased estate, this will hold off late fees (if applicable and 3rd party debt collectors).\nWe do suggest that you contact your family solicitor or the \nCitizens Advice Bureau (C.A.B)\n for free legal assistance. \nThere is an existing debt on the account, but there is no money in the estate to cover it and I can’t afford to pay – what can I do?\nLet us know of your circumstances. We can stop the account from proceeding to a third. party debt collector.\nWe can place the account on hold, so no further late payments occur.\nWe could work with you on a long-term payment arrangement.\nWe could refer you to the Water Utility Consumer Assistance Trust (WUCAT). They are independent and can help customers who are facing financial hardship.\nPlease note, if the estate is being sold the acting solicitor will pay the final water and council rates when the sale goes through as part of their settlement process."

The rest includes organic matter such as human waste, food scraps, cooking fats, oil and grease, and debris such as sand, grit and plastic.\nWastewater can also include household and business chemicals, paint and medicines. These can be harmful to our health, our harbours and waterways, so effective treatment is very important. \nCollecting wastewater\nWhere does your wastewater go?\nEach time you flush the toilet, pull the plug from a sink or have a shower, the water drains into a wastewater pipe on your property.\nOur plants are always operating, treating wastewater so that it is safe to release back into the environment.  We never shut down and we always keep running, even during the worst of weather and power outages.\nTreating wastewater\nMore than 90 per cent of Auckland’s wastewater goes to our plants at Māngere and Rosedale. Here it is treated to standards that protect public health, the local environment and our coasts and harbours. We are continually seeking more environmentally friendly ways of doing this.\nScreening\nBefore treatment, raw wastewater goes through screens to filter out any solids such as rags, debris and other objects. Rotating drum screens feed this material into a conveyor and deposit it in a large bin. Trucks then take it out to landfill.\nTreatment stages\nTreatment takes about 12 hours from start to finish, and we cannot stop it or slow it down.\n1. Separating solids from liquid\nThe wastewater goes into sedimentation tanks where sand and grit is removed, and any solids (sludge) sink to the bottom.\nThe sludge is then thickened and pumped to anaerobic digesters, where it is stabilised. It is then dewatered and limed to become biosolids – ready for disposal or reuse.\nThe liquid then moves to the next treatment stage.\n2. Biological nutrient removal\nThis natural, chemical-free process uses ‘activated sludge’, which contains an army of micro-organisms. They eat the carbon in the liquid wastewater, and reduce the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen. These nutrients can pollute waterways and be toxic to fish.\n3. Settling, filtering and disinfecting\nThe microorganisms are removed as the wastewater passes through clarifiers and filter blocks containing anthracite, a very hard form of coal.\nThe liquid is then disinfected under powerful ultraviolet lamps.  This results in a 10,000-fold reduction of harmful pathogens, bacteria and viruses. There are no chemical byproducts, and it is safe for the environment.\nWhat happens after it's treated?\nAbout 12 hours after it enters the plant, the treated wastewater is safely discharged from the Māngere Wastewater Treatment Plant into the Manukau Harbour. This takes place on an outgoing tide to ensure the discharge is well mixed with the harbour water. At our Rosedale Treatment Plant, treated wastewater is held in two large ponds before being discharged 2km out to sea in the Waitemata Harbour.  \nThe final effluent meets standards that protect public health, the local environment, and Auckland’s coasts, estuaries and harbours.\nWhat are biosolids and how are they used?\nBiosolids are a product of the nutrient-rich, organic sludge produced when we treat wastewater.\nOur aim is to make the best use of this resource, so that we protect and enhance the environment.\nAt our Māngere plant we are using biosolids to restore a former quarry on nearby Puketutu Island.  At other plants, we dispose of biosolids in commercial landfills.\nWe’re also seeking ways to use biosolids in environmentally friendly ways. To explore other options, we are continually working with local iwi and businesses. As well as our own investigations, we draw on the experiences of wastewater utilities around the world.\nOur initiatives include:  \nConsidering how biosolids can be reused to benefit the environment.\nTaking part in an industry working group looking at national environmental standards for biosolids used on land.\nFinding ways to recycle wastewater at our sites and with external customers.\nMaximising the harvesting of biogas from wastewater to create energy.\nChanging technology to minimise our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.\nExploring other opportunities including: extracting valuable end products from the biosolids, creating bio polymers, creating safe-to-use compost and producing phosphorus-rich fertilisers.\nIs wastewater tested?\nOur laboratory performs a range of analyses on wastewater, trade waste and biosolids for waste treatment plants.\nWhat is the Network Discharge Consent?\nThe Network Discharge Consent was issued by Auckland Council in 2014 for a 35-year period. Its purpose is to protect the health of Auckland’s communities and environment (such as beaches and waterways) by setting performance standards for the wastewater network.\nIt authorises an average of two spills per year or an alternative discharge frequency based on the best practicable option. Currently, there are areas in Auckland that do not meet this criterion. Therefore, we are required to rectify this situation and document this in the Wastewater Network Strategy.\nWe are required to consult with mana whenua, council, local boards and the Auckland Regional Public Health Service on our strategy. We are also engaging with special interest groups and people in Auckland. \nWhat is the Wastewater Network Strategy?\nThe Wastewater Network Strategy sets out the actions we plan to take over a six-year period to improve the performance of our wastewater network. It is a requirement of the Network Discharge Consent.\nWhat is wastewater and stormwater?\nWhat is wastewater?\nWastewater, also known as sewage, is the used water that goes down sinks, washing machines, showers, baths, and toilets. Most of it is water. The rest includes human waste, detergents, food scraps, cooking oils and debris.\nWastewater drains into private wastewater pipes. These connect to the public wastewater network which carry household wastewater to treatment plants. At the treatment plants, wastewater is cleaned so that it is not harmful to people or the environment. Depending on the treatment plant, the treated wastewater will be released to sea, rivers or land.\nThe public wastewater network is managed by us.\nWhat is stormwater?\nStormwater is rain. In towns and cities, rain that falls on buildings and roads cannot be absorbed fully by the ground. It needs to be collected into a public stormwater network so that it does not cause flooding. Stormwater that is collected passes through the network and empties directly into streams and the sea.\nThe public stormwater network is managed by Auckland Council. We are not consulting on their network. But if you'd like to learn more, please \nvisit their stormwater infrastructure page\n.\nWhat is a combined network?\nIn some of the older parts of central Auckland, combined networks collect both wastewater and stormwater flows in a single pipe. Combined networks are designed to overflow during rainfall events. To ensure that these overflows occur in a controlled manner, rather than on private property, the network has dedicated engineered overflow points. These discharge through a piped system or designated flow path to the local receiving environment.\nWhat are we doing about overflows from the combined network?\nWe want everyone to be able to enjoy clean waterways and open spaces, so we’re building a wastewater tunnel across central Auckland called the \nCentral Interceptor\n. We also have projects such as the western isthmus, which are separating the stormwater and wastewater pipes. Together, the Central Interceptor and our western isthmus strategy will significantly reduce wastewater overflows in central area. The area that the Central Interceptor project will address has its own consent, due to the timeframe of the project and associated work.\nWhat is an overflow and why does it occur?\nWhat is an overflow?\nA wastewater overflow occurs when wastewater (sewage) spills out from gully traps, manholes, engineered overflow points or pump stations and flows into public or private property. It can flow into waterways and the sea.\nThere are three types of overflows:\nType one: These are from pump stations. These may occur due to power outages or equipment failures, in addition to wet weather and blockages.\nType two: These are from engineered overflow points. They are designed to overflow during heavy storms.\nType three: These are from points in the network, such as manholes and private gully traps.  We rely on people reporting these overflows. \nWhy do overflows occur?\nOverflows can occur anytime, anywhere. The causes may be lack of capacity in the network or blockages or a combination of both. The blockages may be caused by fat, rubbish and tree roots clumping together and restricting the flow. When this happens, wastewater can spill through private gully traps, manholes, engineered overflow points or pump stations.\nOverflows can also occur on rainy days when stormwater enters our wastewater network and overwhelms it.\nDid you know? In heavy rain, the amount of stormwater that drains from an average roof can be equivalent to the wastewater flows from more than 40 households. That’s why it is essential for houses to have rainwater plumbed into approved stormwater outlets, rather than allow it to flow into the wastewater network.\nChild’s play? No way! \nOur staff have pulled numerous toys out of the wastewater network over the years. Other objects include false teeth, ropes, bricks and even wine bottles. But they say cleaning up overflows is no child’s play. They respond very quickly, clear blockages and thoroughly clean the affected area. Our focus is on minimising the risk to public and environmental health.\nWhat happens when an overflow occurs?\nWhen we are notified of an overflow, our crews respond as quickly as possible. They water blast the sewer to clear any blockages. Then they clean and disinfect the area, removing debris and ensuring the area is safe.\nOur operations and planning teams work closely together. The role of the planning team is to investigate the cause of an overflow. They may use a hydraulic model to work out if an overflow was caused by a lack of capacity in the network, a severe storm, or by blockages. They may also arrange CCTV inspections or smoke testing. CCTV checks the condition of the sewer and smoke testing helps to identify cracked drainage as well as incorrect stormwater connections. Sometimes, stormwater drainage is connected to the wastewater network by accident.\nIf the planning team find that the cause of an overflow is a lack of capacity, they will scope upgrade work. This involves securing funding as well as carrying out site and design investigations. Depending on the location and complexity of the upgrade, they may need to coordinate a response with the Local Board, Auckland Transport, Auckland Council, mana whenua, local interest groups and the local community.\nOur engineered overflow points are designed to operate during extreme weather events. These overflows – which consist of wastewater that is heavily diluted with stormwater – flow along waterways to the sea. Auckland Council has a website called \nSafeSwim\n that lets the public know if a beach is safe to swim at from a health and safety perspective. If there is a direct wastewater overflow onto a beach, it is signalled on the website with a black flag.\nWhat can you do to reduce overflows?\nYou and your whānau have a big role to play in keeping our neighbourhoods, local waterways and beaches healthy by reducing overflows. While we take care of the public wastewater network, we need you to maintain your private drainage. We also need you to be mindful about what you pour down the sink and flush down the toilet.\nWhat are we doing to reduce overflows?\nWe plan to invest $10.7 billion in wastewater infrastructure between 2021 and 2041. This is to ensure our ageing network continues to operate reliably as our city grows and climate changes. It is also to ensure we protect the environment by meeting our consent conditions, including the Network Discharge Consent.\nIn our next Wastewater Network Strategy, we will identify the work we need to do to improve the performance of our wastewater network. Our aim is to invest in the network, reduce overflows and improve operation of the network over time – in terms of achieving an average of two spills per year per engineered overflow point or an alternative discharge frequency based on the best practicable option.\nOur strategy will outline three workstreams:\n1. Infrastructure delivery: construction work to upgrade our assets.\n2. Inflow and infiltration programme: inspection work to identify where stormwater is entering the wastewater network.\n3. Community education: educating you and your whānau on the causes of overflows and how we all have a role to play in preventing them. \nWhat is a water and wastewater servicing strategy?\nA water and wastewater servicing strategy is a long-term plan that helps ensure communities have clean and safe water to use and drink, and that the water used is treated properly before being returned to the environment.\nA servicing strategy considers things like finding water sources, making sure we don't waste water, and building treatment plants to clean water and safely dispose of wastewater. The strategy also thinks about how we can ensure we have enough water for the future, and that our assets are durable and resilient to factors such as climate change.\nServicing strategies will be progressively developed for the 30 catchments across our network. In some cases, multiple catchments will be grouped together for a servicing strategy. A good example is the large metropolitan servicing strategy which will include many catchment areas from the North Shore through to South Auckland.\nOur servicing strategies will:\nBe long-term, looking out at least 70 years\nBe cognisant of mana whenua and local community values and aspirations\nConsider long-term impacts of external factors such as population growth, network demand, climate change, and changing regulatory requirements\nBe flexible and adaptable for future uncertainty, providing resilience for future generations\nProvide options and high-level cost estimates\nInform choices about water sources, discharge points, sea-level rise, resource allocation and priorities\nInform our Asset Management Plan (AMP) for future-focused investment planning and prioritisation.\nWhat does a servicing strategy consider?\nThe diagram below shows some of the many factors that the servicing strategies will consider when planning for future decisions and investment. This includes various aspects of community wellbeing such as environmental, social, cultural, and economic. In the process of decision-making, trade-offs between various factors will be important. Making the right trade-offs and investment choices will help future communities remain healthy but also resilient to future challenges.\nWhy the need for a 70 year servicing strategy?\nInfrastructure servicing strategies are plans that ensure our water systems and physical assets are well-maintained and upgraded over time because they play a critical role in our daily lives. We plan for 70 years because infrastructure is expensive to build and maintain, and we want to make sure it lasts. To do this, we use an approach that breaks down the 70-year timeframe into smaller planning periods called horizons (refer to the below image). This helps decision-makers anticipate future needs, plan infrastructure development accordingly, and avoid costly last-minute investments. Anticipating future infrastructure needs can help build community resilience.\nBy anticipating major changes and being willing to adjust the servicing strategies and plans as conditions change, we can develop large-scale infrastructure projects that are aligned with future needs and prepared for potential challenges\nHow do you work with mana whenua?\nOur relationship with mana whenua is a partnership. It is a collaborative relationship between local iwi or hapū, which recognises mana whenua as kaitiaki or guardians of the land. The partnership ensures that cultural values, knowledge, and aspirations are respected and integrated into our decision-making processes. This partnership involves the sharing of information, resources, and decision-making to address community and environmental issues. Working together, we can achieve better outcomes for the community, enhance cultural understanding, and promote environmental sustainability.\nWe recognise the significance of Mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems) and their valuable contribution towards preserving natural resources with a long-term vision. When we develop the servicing strategies and make decisions, these principles provide us with fresh perspectives and opportunities to achieve outcomes that are agreed to by everyone. Through our joint efforts, we can create positive outcomes for the community and safeguard our natural resources for generations to come. ­­"

    "content": "Authority and responsibility for the account \nFor water services, the property owner is always responsible for charges at the property, regardless of any billing arrangement they make with their tenants. \nBy law, we must provide a continuous supply of water as it’s essential for survival. Unlike other utilities such as power or gas, we cannot turn off the service. \n Basically we’re bound to supplying the service to the property, not to individual tenants. So your landlord or property owner must ensure the continuous water supply is paid for. \nYou can find out more on the \nTenancy Services website\n. \nArranging tenant access to the water account (authority access)\nAlthough the ultimate responsibility for payments lies with the property owner (see above), it’s common to have an arrangement with your landlord or property manager, where you pay for your volumetric water and wastewater charges. \nIn this case, it can be easier on both parties for the property owner to give you access (called “authority access”) to talk to us about bills and to make payments directly. \nYour landlord or property manager needs to arrange this with us. They can read more here:  \nHow to grant access to your water account\n \nRegister for MyAccount \nIf you have authority access from the property owner, as a tenant you can use MyAccount, our secure online portal. \nOnce registered online you can pay a bill, or set up a direct debit or recurring credit card payment.  You can also download the app to your phone.  \nWhat you can do in MyAccount.\n  \nYou can also pay a bill.\n   \nMake a one-off payment  \nYou can make a one-off payment using your credit card quickly and easily. You will need your account number.\nPay a bill\n \nSet up recurring payments \nSimply set this up in MyAccount or call us on 09 442 2222, press 2.  \nBefore you set up an automatic payment, there are a few things to consider: \nWe take the total amount due, which is for the water and wastewater services you have used, plus the fixed charges. The landlord is responsible for fixed charges. \nIf you move house and don’t notify us to cancel the payment, we will continue to automatically take money from your bank account each month. It’s your responsibility to cancel a recurring payment. \nTo cancel an existing recurring payment that’s in your name, please call us on 09 442 2222, press 2. \nYou can also set up an automatic payment with your bank. You need to put the account number that you want the money to be sent to as a reference. Check your account balance each month to make sure you aren’t under- or over-paying. Remember to cancel your automatic payment if you move out. \nClick the link below for more information on payment options. \nPay a bill\n \nNote: Landlords can pay an annual fixed charge \n\r\n\r\nLet your landlord know that they can apply to pay an annual fixed charge. \r\nPay a fixed annual charge \nGetting a copy of your bill \nYou can also ask your landlord to arrange a second copy of each bill be sent to you, so you're able to make payment arrangements.  \nNo tenant names will be on the bill \nThe second line of the postal address may say c/- The tenant \nThe owner will receive an email copy of every bill. \nOnly the legal owner’s name will appear on the bill, because the contract is between Watercare and the owner. \nWe send a maximum of one paper bill for each account – all other copies arrive by email. There’s a small cost to getting a paper bill. \nYou can add two email addresses through MyAccount but if you want more, just call us to arrange.  \nIf the property you’re renting has a change in legal ownership \nIn this case we set up a new account in the new owner’s name. \nThe account number for the property will change. If you have a recurring payment (automatic payment, direct debit or direct credit), you will need to set this up again. \nPay a bill"

    "content": "Step 1: Is the meter-read accurate?\nAlthough we take every precaution, we may have read your meter incorrectly. To check if this has happened, you’ll need to read your meter yourself.  \nWater meters are usually located near or just outside your property boundary. They’re in a box made of wood, plastic, concrete or metal. Here’s how to \nfind and read your meter\n. \nCheck that the number on the meter dial is either equal to or slightly higher than the amount on the back of your most recent bill. On a mechanical meter, we bill off the black numbers. On a smart meter, we bill off the numbers before the decimal point. \nIt’s normal to have fluctuations in billed usage compared to your meter reading. This will be corrected on the next billing cycle. If you have a variation of more than 8kls, contact us using our \nonline enquiry \nor call as at (09) 442 2222, press 2.  \nStep 2: Is this a catch-up bill?\nWe aim to have a meter reader take an actual reading of your meter every two months. In between we use your previous two actual readings to calculate an estimated usage.  \nIf you’ve had several estimated bills in a row due to obstacles like access issues and this is your first actual meter read in some time, that could explain why your bill is higher than usual. On your bill, estimated meter reads are shown on the 'billed usage history' graph with an E – actual reads are indicated with an A.   \nIf you have a smart meter, your monthly bills reflect your property’s actual water use. You can view your household data in half-hourly, daily and monthly bites via our free app, available at the App Store or on Google Play. If you see water is being used continuously, you are likely to have a leak. \nLearn more about the app\n \nStep 3: Has your water usage changed?   \nYour bill may be higher if you have extra people staying or living in your home. Ask yourself the following questions: \nHas there been a long period of time where extra people have been living or staying at your property? \nHave you installed new appliances that use more water? \nHave you used your washing machine or dishwasher more often? \nMore people or greater use of appliances will often lead to a higher bill. \n It’s also normal to use more water in summer than in winter months. The following activities can lead to a higher water bill: \n Watering your garden more often \nLeaving outside hoses or sprinklers on by mistake \nUsing a water blaster \nFilling a swimming pool \nShowering more often \nLandscaping or renovating. \nStep 4: Check for a leak \nIf you've ruled out the above, you may have a water leak on your property. But it’s important to do a leak test before calling in a plumber. Follow the link below for how to check for and manage leaks.  \nHow to check for leaks\nPrivate leaks are your responsibility to fix, whereas leaks on the public network are our responsibility. \nHere’s a diagram of your responsibilities and our responsibilities when it comes to pipes\n. If you find a leak on your property, you’ll need to contact a registered plumber to fix it."

You will be notified after 3, 14 and 25 days of continuous water usage.\nHow do I do a leak test using a smart meter?\n  \nFirstly, in the app, go to \nSettings > Help > Checking for a leak\n to see examples of how continuous usage is displayed.\nTraditional leak test methods can still be used for smart meters.\nPick a time when no water will be used for at least four hours – overnight is a good time. \nRead your water meter, then read it again after the period of not using any water. Make sure you don’t use any water during the test. DO NOT turn off the tap on the meter during the test - you need to be able to see if the meter increases while you are not using water, as this helps indicate a leak. For example, if you do an overnight test, you would read your meter at night before bed, then again first thing in the morning. \nIf the meter numbers are higher, this shows that water is being used and it is likely you have a leak. \nI am a landlord.
